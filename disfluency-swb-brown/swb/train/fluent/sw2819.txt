So how do you think we've changed in the last ten to twenty years? I'm at a little bit of a loss. I don't know. Ten years ago. I'm about twenty-eight now. So when I was eighteen. <SEP> Things haven't changed a whole lot. People are being a little less bigoted in some ways. I don't know. <SEP> Seems to me. I guess I'm like my parents. The younger generation gets away with hell. But. <SEP> It seems to me that civic freedoms are more restricted. But that may just be because I've changed. I used to live up north. Down here Dallas seems to me the police are militant. But. Where'd you live up. Where'd you live at. <SEP> I lived in Akron Ohio. Did you? I'm from Illinois. So. How long you been in Dallas? <SEP> About eight years. In fact in the eight years I've been here it seems to me it gets to be more and more restrictive place to live. <SEP> As you're talking police and stuff like that it's definitely a tough job to do. I think it's. Crime has got a lot worse in the last ten fifteen years. I agree. <SEP> And maybe that has a lot to do with it. I definitely think that has gotten a lot worse. And I think there's. To me there seems to be a little bit of a decline in the family values. That's true. <SEP> That's true. But. I'd say my own personal lifestyle has improved. <SEP> But that's more a matter of. I'm no longer a teenager in high school. I think there's more pressure on both parents to work and things like that than there used to be. And. <SEP> Somebody's at the door. Hang on just a second. <SEP> But I don't know. That's one thing I see a lot more double income families and a lot more baby sitters raising the kids and things like that I guess. That's true. It's getting more and more expensive to live. That's for sure. <SEP> You can't make it. Without it hardly. That's right. I guess when I was growing up it was still the ideal to get a home and buy house. And these days you see a lot of people living in apartments forever. <SEP> You just don't buy a house. Just because they can't get into one. That's right. The ways our tax laws and stuff are structured you can't ever catch a break until you can get into a house in a lot of ways. <SEP> So. That's a good point. So I'm trying to think of anything else that's changed over the last ten or twenty years. For me it's kind of hard. I don't know. I think. I don't know I think the middle class is shrinking and the lower class is expanding. I agree. <SEP> And sooner or later there's going to be a turn around. I hope so at some point. But I don't know at what point. But I think it's going to be at the expense of the middle class. <SEP> So usually is I think. It's. <SEP> It's hard for me to say. I hope it happens because I'd be one of those that gets caught. But on the other hand there's a lot of injustice that needs to be changed. That's right. Do you work at T I? Do you? <SEP> What department do you work in? I'm in semiconductor. Are you? I'm in semiconductor division too. <SEP>. How long you been with them since you moved down here? About eight years. I'm over at the Center One building. <SEP> So am I. Are you really. What floor? Two. I'm on the seventh floor. <SEP> How about that. It's a small world. So let's see. Second floor you work with linear. Do you know Alec Morton? <SEP> I've probably seen him around. You do. He comes up and pushes us around. So I'm pretty familiar with. Are you D A D or something up there? <SEP> Are you D A D or something? You must know him. His reputation precedes him. Seventh floor. <SEP> T A D. He comes up there and gives us all kinds of grief. They say it's what makes him happy is to give us D A D -ers grief. So I can believe it. But. Let's see if you've been in Dallas eight years I guess that's about how long. I've been in here about eight years too I guess. Been with T I twelve. But I started out in Lubbock. <SEP> Lubbock is. I don't know. I guess if this is the only place you've lived Lubbock is a lot different than Dallas. Flat dry and dirty. <SEP> But the people all seem to be a lot more laid back too. Here in Dallas everything is just real rush rush. I lived in the country for several years. And living in the city is a whole different social structure. <SEP> But. I got some friends that. Seems like he went to school at DeVry. Is there a DeVry in Akron? I don't even know. <SEP> I haven't been up there in years. I see. He went to school somewhere in Ohio. And he's from that area. And he works over in the Park Central building I think. But I haven't talked to him in a while. But. He misses it. He used to go back twice or three times a year because he missed it. Sounds like you haven't been back there in a while. I haven't been back in ten fifteen years. You still have relatives back there. Or. <SEP> I do. I just haven't had a chance to get back. Catch them next year probably. Let's see. How long are we supposed to talk here? <SEP> I don't know. I think we ran out of social changes to talk about. So. My kids are probably needing me to go. So. <SEP> It's nice talking to you. Talk to you later. <SEP>.
