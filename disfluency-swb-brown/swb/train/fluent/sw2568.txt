. What's your most recent one that you've seen? <SEP> Actually what I do. I haven't been to a movie theater in probably eight or nine months. So I haven't really seen any movies in the movie theater. But I rent probably four or five movies a week. I used to do that too. But I haven't been doing it lately. But. <SEP> We've got a good video place out here. And I'm just trying to think of all the movies I've recently seen. AIR AMERICA. I haven't seen that one. Have you seen WILD ORCHID? Is it good? <SEP> It depends. Do you like steamy movies. Not ye-. I know that sounds funny coming from a woman. But usually I don't. What type of movies do you like? Action. <SEP> Bu- d-. I guess two of my favorite movies is probably LETHAL WEAPON and LETHAL WEAPON TWO. And those are two of my most favorite. They're just really good movies. And I liked BIRD ON A WIRE. And movies like that. <SEP> Do you like suspense movies. Or do you like just action. Or. Some like. What do you mean. Are you talking about movies like DIE HARD TWO. <SEP> JAGGED EDGE. JAGGED EDGE was a suspenseful one. Or FATAL ATTRACTION. I liked that. That was pretty good. That was okay. I guess I thought it was too far fetched. But so many people said it wasn't. But I guess. <SEP> I hope I don't run across them. That's true because. I don't know. I just didn't find that one to be real. I just thought it was too far fetched. What was your favorite all time movie? I can't think off my head. Do you know which one yours was? <SEP> I have to say that probably the one movie that really threw me back the most that I was really the most in shock with was probably STAR WARS. That's. When that first came out I really did not expect the special effects or anything like that. <SEP> Out of all the movies I've never been as excited to go back. I was ready to go back and see it again. You're right about that. But that's really an all time classic. I don't think anything could ever beat that. I also liked GONE WITH THE WIND or some of the classic like THE LAWRENCE OF ARABIA. I've never seen that. <SEP> You haven't? Should I rent it? Should I go rent it tomorrow. <SEP> That's a real interesting movie. And it's got a good historical perspective to it. That's probably something I need to see right now because I'm taking history in school. So it'd probably be a good thing for me to see. <SEP> Actually I just saw a movie called THE LOST CAPONE. And it's about Al Capone's brothers. Primarily one of his brothers. <SEP> And I won't give the whole plot away. But it's really a good movie. Al Capone had three brothers. And one of them was lost for many many years. And he turns out to be a law man. <SEP> It's really interesting. It. You just gave it away. I guess I can't go see it. That's okay. I didn't give away the whole thing. I just gave away just enough to get you interested. That does sound good. Is it one. I guess it's a rental. <SEP> It is. I may have to do that. Go see it. Or go rent it. And a lot of times what I wind up doing is picking an actor or an actress and seeing all. <SEP> I've seen all of James Dean's movies. All of Mae West's movies. And just kind of go out and rent all the movies and just kind of go. I guess you could do that get all of David Carradine's movies or Segal. <SEP> To. What's his first name. I can't remember his first name. It's not David is it? Is it David Segal. I don't know. He was on Arsenio just recently. I don't watch that. <SEP> It was really kind of interesting because Arsenio was asking him about what he thought of one of the other action guys. I can't even remember the name. He said he wouldn't really talk about it. Didn't want to talk about him because he didn't think he was such a good action guy. <SEP> It wasn't Stallone. It was. I can't remember. I can't remember the guy's name. But I like all the RAMBO movies. That's one side of the action that I didn't really care for. But I don't really like Sylvester Stallone. I don't think he's really a very good actor. I know that sounds awful because so many people think he's so wonderful. But I just have never been a Stallone fan. <SEP> Adrian. That's pretty good. Like I say. I just have I don't know I just have never seen any interest in him. But. <SEP> We actually rent probably a good combination of movies with the exception of horror films. Don't watch really very many horror films at all. I don't either. <SEP> I don't know. There's something about people coming up through the sofa to get you or something coming out of the T V that just doesn't make my day. You're right. It's so. I guess I'm a realist and so when I watch movies like that it's this can not happen. So I just don't enjoy it because it's just come on give me a break. <SEP> I just. And so many of them are done so poorly. It just doesn't even give you the effect. Some of them are done good. And they do scare you. But so many of them are just done real. I don't know. I'm not really into those. <SEP> I just saw a really interesting movie called FLATLINERS. That was one of my favorites. I thought that was a very good movie. <SEP> I was really impressed with that one. What I liked about it was that it was a new subject. Nobody had ever touched it before. And it was done so well. It was just. <SEP> It was just crazy enough for th-. Students might try to do it. And it's not like there's a lot of scientific data on it. That's probably true. But it was a very good movie. It was done real well too. There wasn't any part of it that you really felt this can't happen. It seemed real. It was really good. That was one. It's not my all time favorite movie. But it was good. It was really good. <SEP> And I don't know if you like this kind. But I thought PRETTY WOMAN was a really good movie too. That was a great movie. We've seen that two or three times. We waited. And we rented it. <SEP> But it was really good. Have you seen SHRIMP ON THE BARBY? I haven't. I don't know if I've even heard of that one. <SEP> It's got. It must have what's his name in it. It doesn't. <SEP>. Hogan? Paul Hogan. <SEP> I'm surprised. It's got Cheech Marin. That must be pretty good then. Was it good. <SEP> It is. It's kind of a poor man's PRETTY WOMAN in reverse. But it was kind of cute. Actually did you see DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS? <SEP> I though that was a really cute movie. I enjoyed that. It was. TWINS was good too. Because when I thought of that I thought of. There was another one. What's the one that just. DANCES WITH WOLVES have you seen that yet? I haven't. You've got to see that one. It's really. <SEP> I hear that's the one that you really need to see at the theater instead of home video. That's probably true. That's probably true. It's very very good. Very good. That's another one that. I was really glad when it won all those awards because it really deserved it. <SEP> My wife has got a picture from Kevin Costner. And he signed it. It's from DANCES WITH WOLVES. And he signed it. He happens to be a friend of one of her business associates. Or not a friend a cousin. That's impressive. <SEP> But we got a nice picture. And it came in an envelope that says DANCES WITH WOLVES. So we've got to try to get out there and see that one. It's really worth it. It's a very good movie. And. I would suggest seeing it at the theater. I know that they're still playing it. And they pushed it back to playing it in the theaters until August. <SEP> I think because they were scheduling a video release of it in July. And then when it won all those awards they pushed it back to August. So. But. That one is definitely worth seeing. It's really good. Did you see DRIVING MISS DAISY? And I didn't think that one was near as good. <SEP> I guess it was okay. It was all right. But when I compare the winners of this year and last year it just. I don't know. Maybe it's not.
