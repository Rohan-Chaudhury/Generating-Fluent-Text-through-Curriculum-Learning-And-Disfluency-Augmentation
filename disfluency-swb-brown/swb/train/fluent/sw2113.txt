The last movie that I saw. I don't go to that many. So I'll just have to talk about the ones that I went to see. But it was AWAKENINGS with Robin Williams and Peter DeNiro. <SEP> Have you seen it. Unfortunately I haven't. I heard it's really good. But. It is. I just have to take my hat off to Peter DeNiro. <SEP> He is one of the best actors I've ever seen. It's. There's a point where. The show is about these catatonic type people that. This doctor discovers a drug that brings them back to the living more or less. But it wears off. And the way it wears off is he goes through all these spastic. It starts off with a tic. <SEP> And then it gets to where he can't control his movements at all. And it was just so realistic. The way you have to just keep reminding yourself that he's an actor. What. Is. Robin Williams does he have a funny part in it? It was very se-. <SEP> How does he do serious. He's good. He's talented. He is. I've only seen him in funny stuff. And so. I know. Me too. But what was that show Garf-. I want to say Garfield. But that wasn't it. <SEP> THE WORLD ACCORDING TO GARP. THE WORLD ACCORDING TO GARP. He wasn't always funny in that show was he. I didn't see the movie. I read the book. But I. I did too. That's why I was thinking it couldn't be just a totally funny part. <SEP> In fact it got some pretty serious deep parts in it. So. What have you seen? <SEP> I think the last movie that we went out to see was DANCES WITH WOLVES. I saw it. We've both seen one. Did you cry through it? The whole way. <SEP> It was telling a friend I said I only cried twice. But each was about half an hour long. Where did you cry. Let's see. Each time that I thought that the Indians were going to get killed I cried. <SEP> I cried the first time when the wagon man got killed when they attacked him. And I think from there on all the way through the movie. Let's see what else did it. What other parts. I can't remember any of the other parts right off now. I cried when the horse got killed and when the wolf got killed. <SEP> We-. I don't remember when the horse got killed. Th-. When he was riding back to the settlement and they shot his horse out from under him. And then the next day he looked out there and saw those buzzards. <SEP> And that horse has been such a pal to him when he was alone. You can tell I'm an animal lover. You can hear my dog. <SEP> Unfortunately we don't have any animals. So. It was a beautiful story. It really was. It. There was a lot of pretty scenery too in that movie. <SEP> What did you think about the buffalo scenes. I thought it was awful and so graphic. That was. <SEP> I hadn't even imagined it. I think we all heard the story of the slaughter of the buffalo. I had a friend who had fixed some buffalo chili about a week before went to see the movie. <SEP> Of course they raise them now to eat. It's not. But we were both feeling so guilty about enjoying this chili after seeing that. <SEP> At least you know that it wasn't same situation that the buffalo died in. It wasn't. I thought the scenes when the buffalos running though were beautiful. That was great. <SEP> And there were so many of them. I didn't know that that many buffaloes alive much less in one place. That was pretty. And to think about how it just changed the whole landscape you could follow this beaten down path. <SEP> And it sounded like thunder and earthquakes and that sort of thing. I wonder how they kept up with them though. It seemed like the buffaloes were moving so fast. I know. <SEP> I guess they graze though. That wouldn't be a problem. Have you seen any of the behind the scenes of that movie. It was. They tried to keep it very close to real. <SEP> Kevin Costner did all of his own scenes. And they had to teach a wolf how to howl. That's the part they had trouble finding was wolves. <SEP> I guess they're just not domesticated. Or. What. They just don't howl that much anymore. That'll teach them in a couple minutes. I could bring them in with my dogs and set a siren off. And that's all they'd have to do. <SEP> That's funny. I think we've made it. <SEP> Is that five minutes. Is that. I don't know. Is it five or three. I'm not sure. I'm not either. <SEP> I think we've done okay though. Me too. Thank you for calling. Thank you. <SEP> And I hope you enjoy some more good movies late-. You too.
