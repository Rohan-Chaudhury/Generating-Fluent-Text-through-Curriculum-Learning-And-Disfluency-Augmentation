. I am the product of as much the changing roles of women as anyone. My mother. We come from a. My mother and I were really first generation divorce in our family. <SEP> My mother was divorced in nineteen fifty-seven when I was seven years old. <SEP> And I was the first one of anyone that anyone had ever known to have a divorce. Of course now fifty percent divorces in the United States. My mother was treated very badly by a lot of family members especially from my father's side of the family. And also we were ostracized by his family basically we just kind of dropped off the face of the earth. <SEP> And they all felt that there was never an issue that my father was the cause of the reason for the split up even though he had impregnated another woman and forced the divorce. <SEP> It was always my mother's fault she was not sufficient she just was not good enough. What was wrong with her was she not attractive enough did she not take good enough care of her man to keep his interest. It was that kind of an attitude. That's too bad. So. It was too bad. It was really rough. That's sad. It really is. <SEP> So that's so changing. Some of the changing roles of women in that respect I have been a product of. I think that there are people that. I was first generation going to college in my family. <SEP> First my mother had always had a quote career but always a career in a secretarial position. She did rise to the highest position that a woman could rise to in a secretarial profession in Des Moines Iowa. That's wonderful. She was a secretary to a federal judge. <SEP> And it was a lifetime appointment for her as well as for him. So that was a really high status position. That's wonderful. She made over thirty thousand a year. That speaks well of your mother. <SEP> She a real hard la-. She had high standards. <SEP>. Hard driving lady with a steel rod up her back. Bless her heart. <SEP> So I went to college and now since have completed two master's degrees. And I am the director of music in a church. But interestingly enough I am still everyday confronted with. Challenges. <SEP> Challenges that have to do with my sex. For instance I am just not taken as seriously at professions as many of the men who are doing the same job I do. <SEP> And the choir members treat me differently because I am a woman they expect me to be more motherly. They question my authority more than they ever would a man. And I have experience with this because I work both as a director of music and also as an associate under a man. So I am pretty aware of what goes on in the church. <SEP> So basically that's. I am done talking. Do you want to talk? I think that you carried forth your subject matter very well Nickie. And I can relate to that. I think it's the image that the woman has in the world as the lesser of the two. <SEP> Always. And I think things are changing. But the changing is taking a long time longer than we would like it to take. <SEP> And I think we are progressing at a snail's pace. But we are progressing. <SEP> So that's the main point is that we are going ahead. And I think that in the long term that women are going to be able to have the recognition that they deserve. <SEP> And men a lot of them have come around and have seen the error of their ways. <SEP> But there are a lot of die-hards out there that will never change. So we have to face that reality also. <SEP> I have never been able to figure out why they can not ever change why they can not bend. Why they can not just accept competent women. I have never been able to understand that. I guess it's fear. What. It could be if they are not sure of themselves. The ones that go along with that they are sure of themselves. <SEP> And they know that they can be on the same level. And they do not have any ego problems that they are fighting. <SEP> And I think that we are going to be on par with them in salary and in recognition in the long term. <SEP>. And what I would like to see happen futuristically is what we are discussing is that we each have our jobs in life and that we should recognize that. And that we should support each other. <SEP>. <SEP>. And I think our problems would be fewer if we supported each other. And just looked at each other as equals and none lesser because we are equal. <SEP>. <SEP> Men have a lot of trouble with that though. In their own peer relationships they do not treat themselves equal. And so it's really difficult for them to treat women as equals. They are really much more comfortable with somebody being the boss and somebody being the follower. It seems that they are more comfortable that way. And I do not know if it's a militaristic point of view. Somebody can not be colonel. And everybody else is infantry. But it's just really interesting to me. I am married to a wonderful man who treats me with as. <SEP> I think probably is as enlightened as anyone can be at this particular stage in their life time. But when he gets angry it's always over control issues it's always over power issues it's never over it's always you said you were going to do something. And you did not do it. As if he is the boss. And I am the slave. And it. Those are the only issues we ever fight about. I think it's just difficult for men to accept women equally. Even if they want to they are more comfortable when somebody is the boss. Dictatorships are real efficient. I guess we would have to go back to the way that the Lord made us. <SEP> And the women when they are married they are to be subjective to their husbands. And I believe that strongly. <SEP> But I think that they should be in harmony with what they are with what the subject matter is. And I think the issue should be settled before there's a conflict. <SEP> And I think that can happen in a very wonderful way. And if we men and women would do as the Bible said that we would esteem each other higher than ourselves. <SEP> Can you picture that? If your husband did that to you and you did that to your husband you would always be trying to please each other and not yourself. <SEP>. <SEP> It's true. And that's really the divine answer and the right answer. <SEP> So that would be a beautiful relationship. It would be. And I think there are some people that have done that. <SEP> And I have seen it. And it's just marvelous. And I am just in awe to see this.
