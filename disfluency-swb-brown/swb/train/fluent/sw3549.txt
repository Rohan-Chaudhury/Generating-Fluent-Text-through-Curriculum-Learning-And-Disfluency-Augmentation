What are you guys having for Christmas? What are we having? Let's see. I'm not planning the menu. You're not. <SEP> We usually go out to either one of our folks. They both live close to. But I don't know. It seems like a big thing for Christmas is usually ham. Funny you should mention that. I'm a pig farmer. <SEP> You are. It's kind of a hobby more than anything else. But we're going to have wild boar. <SEP> We killed a boar the other day. It was mating with the sows. And you can't use the piglets. So. It's about six months of no use. So we shot him and cleaned him out and had him processed into ham. And we're also going to have a little roast suckling pig because I've got one that's got a hernia. <SEP> And rather than pay the vet four hundred dollars for surgery we'll just cook him and eat him. Is that hard? I tell you what preparing a little pig is a snap. <SEP> I'm telling you real easy easier than chicken. You just. You kill him. You probably. Most guys just shoot them in the head. They go. In a second they're gone. <SEP> And then you just dip the carcass in boiling water pull it out and gut it and just stick it down in a pit with some cloves and some pineapple about three pineapples and cover him up with wet sacks and then start a charcoal fire on top of him. <SEP> And after about six hours you put the fire out and dig that baby out of there. And it's the best eating you ever had. Does a boar taste just like regular ham? Just like a pig. <SEP> Does it. It has a lot less fat. This wild boar weighed probably about three hundred and thirty pounds. <SEP> And he dressed out to almost two hundred and ten pounds. We took the skin and the head and the feet off. And that was about a hundred pounds of just ham. <SEP> How many people are you planning on serving at Christmas? We're not going to eat the whole thing. Eat it all. It would take a year. But we're going to drive up to Kansas City see my wife's folks. And she. What's your mother cooking for Christmas. Her mom's doing brisket. <SEP> I don't. What is brisket? Brisket? It's a part of the cow that they used to throw away. It's just tough as a boot. <SEP> And they used to use it for leather I think. I was kidding. <SEP> But it's a part of the loin the rib cage. And it has a lot of muscle in it and a lot of gristle where it attaches to the ribs. So it's really a tough piece of meat. <SEP> But it's so tasty you can't stand it. So you just take it. And you marinate it for a couple of days. <SEP> And that softens it up. And then you just put it in the oven. Takes about four hours to cook one. They weigh about anywhere from ten to twenty pounds. <SEP> And we're going to have that. What else do you serve with your pig? We'll have cranberries and hominy. And we're big on olives and cucumbers and stuff up here. <SEP> We have black olives and cucumbers and tomatoes. We still have tomatoes. Do you? Fresh tomatoes. <SEP> We just got lots of snow. It started to freeze up around here. There's nothing between you and us but our barb wire and half of that's down. It's thirty degrees this morning. <SEP> But it'll go up to fifty or sixty almost. I didn't know it got that low at night. It's desert. Where we are it's the edge of the desert. It's part of the Great Plains. So in the day time in the summer it goes up to a hundred hundred and ten. <SEP> And at night it goes down to about sixty. We get a fifty degree temperature swing in about four hours. <SEP> So everything that lives around here is real tough. That's trees. We got hundred year old trees that are twenty feet tall. <SEP> That's all the bigger they get. They're just hard as a rock.
