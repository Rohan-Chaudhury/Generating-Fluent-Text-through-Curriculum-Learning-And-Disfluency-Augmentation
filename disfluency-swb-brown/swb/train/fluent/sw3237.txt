So you said that you live in Coppell. So what is your house like? <SEP> It's a two bedroom two baths duplex. That's neat. Brick and. <SEP> Is it one you're renting or buying? We own it. Our side. That's kind of neat that even though it's a duplex you can still buy. <SEP> That's good. Do you have any children? <SEP> Do you? I have two children. And our home is really too small for us right now. Ours is too. <SEP> We outgrew it when we moved in. We moved from an apartment that was really small. <SEP> And at the time we just had a little baby that was five months old. So we moved into this house in Garland. It's in one of the older areas of town. <SEP> And one thing I really like is it has big trees everywhere. Lots of shade and squirrels and birds and real pretty. <SEP> But the house is real small. It has less than a thousand square feet. <SEP> It's real little. You all are cramped. And now I have a daughter. Now. The one that was five months old is seven years old. <SEP> And I have another one that's three and a half and have all these clothes and toys and stuff that we're just trying to find places to put. <SEP> How many bedrooms is it? They advertised it as a three bedroom house because it has a built on addition room. <SEP> But the room that's built on doesn't have a closet. <SEP> So the people that lived here before us did use it for a bedroom. But we have always just put our computer and extra toys and books and. <SEP> It's kind of a catch all room. But it sure is nice to have it when the kids come over to play. <SEP> They all go out there to play with the Barbies and that kind of stuff. So. <SEP> How fun. That works out good. And I'm thankful I have two girls because they're in bunk beds. And so they can share a room and make for more space that way. <SEP>. <SEP> And how old's the youngest? She's three and a half. And right now we have their clothes on double racks in the closet. <SEP> We made a higher and a lower. And it works out fine. But they're just about to get too tall where the dresses are beginning to drag. <SEP> And we're going to have to figure out a new idea. But we're kind of looking around and wanting to move into a bigger home hoping to be able to do that within a year or so. <SEP>. So that would be nice. <SEP> That's what we'd like to do. Is Coppell a nice area to live? It's a wonderful place to live. And they. I don't have any kids. So I don't really know. But they say that we have wonderful schools. I think I've heard a lot about Coppell schools that they're real good. <SEP> That's neat. Do you hope to have children. Or are you not planning on having any. Or. <SEP> I don't think so. I see. Do you have any pets? <SEP> Of course those are my kids. I have two dogs. <SEP> Do they stay inside. Or. They're inside dogs. That's neat. <SEP> They're my babies. What are the colors in your house? <SEP> Kind of a mauve and gray. I bet that's pretty. And then the kitchen's kind of a country pink and country blue. And it's all done in cows. <SEP> I'm a cow nut. That's neat. I like cows too. <SEP> Our house was redo-. Our house is very old also. It's thirty-seven years old. <SEP> And it was redone before we moved in which. I'm thankful for that. But the. It was redone at the time when earth tones were in. Everything is. <SEP> The carpet's kind of a tan and brown and has paneling in the living room and lots of tans and lots of browns. <SEP> But the good thing is you can bring out other colors from that. So that's worked out good. In the kitchen they put real pretty blue and tan wallpaper had done it up with blues. <SEP> So that's nice. But. Sounds pretty. We've enjoyed living here. <SEP> It's close to my oldest daughter's school. And that makes it really handy too. <SEP> And she really likes her school. So. And we are so close to shopping. And. <SEP> That's an important factor there. How about in Coppell? I've always imagined it kind of out away from everything. Now we have that new mall in Lewisville. <SEP> And that's just a mile or two from our house. That's nice. But when we first moved to Coppell six years ago we didn't even have a grocery store. <SEP> And now we have four. And Coppell's not really big enough to support four grocery stores. <SEP> But it does sound like it's definitely growing. Very much. <SEP> In fact it's about the size now. I moved down here from Chicago twenty-three years ago to Lewisville. <SEP> And Coppell's now about the size that Lewisville was when I moved down here. I see. When we first moved here we moved here from Lubbock. <SEP> And we almost moved to Lewisville. That was our second choice behind Garland. At the time we thought we might buy a mobile home.
