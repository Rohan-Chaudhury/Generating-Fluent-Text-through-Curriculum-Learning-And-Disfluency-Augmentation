What movies have you seen recently Valerie? Let's see. The last one we saw was THELMA AND LOUISE. We haven't seen that one yet. <SEP> Don't bother. It wasn't that good. From a woman's point of view it was very chauvinistic as far as women go. It was entertaining. But. I don't think the general audience would go for it. The most recent one that my wife and I have seen was the CITY SLICKER. <SEP> How was that? That was excellent. It was just a really funny movie. That is one I've been dying to see. At the same time it had a story line about people trying to find themselves. There were parts that were sad. It just ran the gamut of emotion. <SEP> And. But it was just all around entertaining. How long did that movie run? It's still on to the best of my knowledge. <SEP> But time wise how long. Was it two hour. Or. I think it's less than two hours. <SEP>. We rented one recently that seemed to go on forever. That always seems to happen when you rent them. But this one it was fairly long. I'm guessing probably an hour and forty-five minutes maybe. <SEP> And it. But excellent acting by Billy Crystal and Bruno Kirby. Was it good. <SEP> Who was the. Jack Palance had an excellent part in there as the old cowboy. So we really enjoyed that. <SEP> I'm looking forward to seeing that one. That was next on our list. So. I think that I can highly recommend that movie to see. Good deal. <SEP> Good deal. Do you rent movies very often. Or. We generally rent a couple a week. In order to get a decent movie to have on a weekend you've got to rent it on Thursday. <SEP> They get taken up at the store. That's exactly right. So. <SEP> We will rent two or three movies on Thursday. And with luck you'll have one or two that are good. Most of them are a coin flip. <SEP>. And we usually have we don't get out as much as we like. We have two children. So we occasionally get out to the movies. But it's a fun thing to do to get out and be entertained for once. <SEP> Quite frequently we have our grandchildren on the weekends. And we'll try to rent something that they can see as well as something else that we can see. And generally try to stay in the at least P G range. <SEP> What ages are they? Have you found trouble finding movies for them. Or. <SEP> The oldest is nine. The youngest is three. He doesn't really pay attention. The five year old doesn't have the attention span either. <SEP> But the nine year old will watch anything that's on T V. <SEP> They have been doing that. We've been waiting for a good movie out this summer for the kids to see. The last one they saw was HOME ALONE. And they enjoyed that. But I missed that one. My husband took the kids to see that one. So. My wife took the kids to see that one. But we can generally find something at the store for them to watch. <SEP> That's a good deal. The. We saw this movie. PRESUMED INNOCENT was the one we rented last weekend. Let me think if I have rented that one. <SEP> Harrison Ford. Harrison Ford and how does the story line go? He is a prosecuting attorney. And a woman prosecutor in there is murdered. <SEP> We haven't seen that one. And he's trying to find it. But course it's one of these with a twist where it looks like he's the one that wound up killing her. And it's an extremely long movie. It's over two hours long. <SEP> Which. My wife she likes the suspense movies. I enjoy them to a degree. <SEP> I think that's the one I wanted to pick up the other day. And then my husband wasn't going to be able to watch it with me. So I thought I better save that one for another day. Save that for another day. Because I think he'd like that one. <SEP> You enjoyed that one then. It's something I think you would enjoy. That's a good one to put on the list. It's like most suspense movies. What was. It was on T V recently FATAL ATTRACTION. <SEP> It's one that once you've seen it once you really can't see it again. You know all the story and who did what and when it happened. <SEP> So once you seen one that's a suspenseful type movie like that then it's not good for a second watching particularly. <SEP> At least I don't think so. I don't think too many of them are anymore. It's a shame. But. I don't know. We've watched WEEKEND AT BERNIE'S any number of times. <SEP> I know. It's just slapstick comedy. Sit there and laugh. And my one grandson and I. My wife can't understand it. But we like BILL AND TED'S EXCELLENT ADVENTURE which is another funny one. <SEP> We've heard about that one. But we haven't seen that one either. So it sounds like you and your grandson like the same kinds of movies. We like to laugh. <SEP> I have a theory. I like movies for entertainment. I don't want to go away depressed from watching a movie. <SEP> I agree. I agree. Life's depressing enough. <SEP> That's for sure. I've certainly enjoyed talking with you. You too Jim. <SEP> Thanks for punching in. And. Have a nice weekend. I hope you see a good movie soon. <SEP>.
