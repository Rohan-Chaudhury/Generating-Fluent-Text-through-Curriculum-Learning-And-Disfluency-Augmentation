Are you there? Tell me your favorite team. <SEP> Baseball? I've kind of been intrigued with the Rangers more so with their management than anything else. I don't follow baseball that closely. But since I live here so close to Arlington that's the team that I've been kind of following. I think it's a little bit late in the season for them to assign us. Where do you think they're headed. So we'll have to talk about the future with the Rangers. <SEP>. What are your thinkings on what they can do what they'll be able to do? <SEP> I think that with so much controversy over Ruben Sierra not signing and asking us for so much money it's I think. I'm not real sure about th-. Do you know anything about Ruben Sierra's. I heard tonight on the news that he is willing to come down. On his. That he was willing to come down a little bit if the Rangers will go up a little bit. <SEP> And the Rangers go up a little bit. <SEP> But a little bit from thirty million dollars or thirty-five mil-. That's a lot of money. I think the entire baseball. They're the ones that probably are paying the highest. They are. And I think this is absolutely ridiculous. <SEP>. And I really think that they ought to. I'm not real sure that they should pay him that much money. I think they should pay him what his salary is going to be and let him. Because he's got one more year before he turns into a free agent. That's right. <SEP> And then who knows. If he produces next year they may have to end up paying him anyway. But if he doesn't then his market value will go down. And they can pick him up for a lot less than they would if they paid him the six million dollars a year this year. What I saw on the news today that. Buechele was back just to visit. <SEP> I'm awful sorry he's not still. But what he. That was a great deal for him. I'm sure it was. <SEP> It was a great deal for him. And he just signed on. I think it was a five year deal with Pittsburgh. Pittsburgh. <SEP> So he's real happy there. As far as the Rangers are concerned I think they definitely need some pitching. And so I. What do you think of Howse who is the coach for the pitchers? <SEP> The pitching coach? I was just looking at the news tonight. And they showed a black guy that was helping out His assistant. His assistant. <SEP> And I think that's a great addition. He seemed to know what he was doing. And. I really wish they could see fit to get rid of Howse. <SEP> You don't like Howse? I really don't. And I'm not going to stand up on my soapbox and say that. <SEP> But I'm not fond of Howse. <SEP> And I'm not fond of Grieves. Tom Grieve? <SEP> I'm not sure that they're ready to get rid of Tom Grieve yet. But Howse might be a different situation. And I think you're probably right that they need some changes in pitching coach maybe. And. I'm just gullible enough that I think Bobby Valentine is doing all right. And I'm sure. You do? <SEP> That's contrary to popular belief. I know. I know so. But I would like so much for these Rangers to get their act together and give Nolan Ryan the support he needs. I know. It's too bad that it has to be a forty-two year old guy to lead the Rangers. I understand. <SEP> They need to have some young guys that can take the lead. And. I have so many mixed emotions about all this. But I think with their new stadium they should go and let.
