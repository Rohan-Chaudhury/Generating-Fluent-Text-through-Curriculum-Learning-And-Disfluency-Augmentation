What are your suggestions in making a family reunion successful. Have a big family I guess. That's a start. I guess so. <SEP> Ha-. How old are you? Twenty-five. So. So you have been to some family reunions perhaps. <SEP> I just got married. Every four years on one side of my family they plan on having my grandparents and all their brothers and sisters and then all their kids and grandkids. How long in advance do they let them know? <SEP> We plan on it. It's the third weekend in August. So it's every four years. And so. So they all know it. <SEP> And then arrangements are made during the Summer for food and who's staying where because a lot of people are from down here in Texas. And a lot of my family is in Indiana. That's where I'm originally from. <SEP> So we usually meet at my uncle's cottage at the lake and make a couple days of it. That sounds like fun. Do they all have the small children too that come? Pretty much. So all ages. <SEP> And there's some my age. And then there are some a lot younger about four generations I guess. My husband on one side has an extended family. And they don't ever plan it like you do. <SEP> I think if you can count on it every four years then people have it in mind. So they have to start talking about it or getting their act together about six months ahead to get in touch with everybody because they're rather socially active too. <SEP> And so it seems by doing it about six months ahead they can pretty much get everybody there. If they don't they'll say we're planning to go to a certain place that weekend with somebody else. And we're already locked in. But six months ahead has seemed to be okay for them. My parents are the youngest of very large families. <SEP> Therefore they don't have many people left. And the few previous ones I've had. I haven't known many of those people. But in the last few years it really has just been our immediate family. And that's been very nice. With. I have one sister and three brothers. <SEP> And they're only three out of five of us who have children. So we get to spend a lot of quality time with each other. <SEP> And that's kind of nice because my husband's family reunions are so large. And they don't see each other very often. We don't really know many of them. <SEP> That's kind of bad. It really is. They're fun. They're a lot of fun. But still they're not done on a regular basis. And you kind of forget what happened and who they were from the time before. <SEP> It's fun getting together with immediate family. A lot of my cousins are real close. And we always get together during holidays and weddings and stuff like that. So. Those are the ones that are in Texas? Or you go to Indiana on that? <SEP> The ones in Indiana. Where in Indiana? Lafayette. Lafayette I don't know where. I used to live in Indianapolis. <SEP> It's a little north of Indianapolis about an hour. It's very pretty country in there I think. It's gorgeous. So. I. When is your next one scheduled now. <SEP> It's like the last one was my high school graduation. The next one was when I graduated from college. So I guess about two more years. And do you think you'll have a baby to take back with you. Maybe. I don't know. Maybe. <SEP> Two more years. I don't know. Probably. You need another milestone. I guess that's what. I've been married now for about nine months. So that was another milestone I guess. I'm sure. And then all of your family probably has not met your husband. <SEP> He's from Indiana. Is he? So they all met. And you're both living in Sherman. <SEP> Do you work to T I? And does he? <SEP> He's trying to get in med school. So. We don't either. But I have a friend who is working on this project. And. <SEP> Are they getting all the data they need? I don't know. I have a hard time getting people on the telephone. Getting through to anybody. Sometimes I call off and on all day. <SEP> But anyway I guess we're supposed to be talking about family reunions aren't we. But I got off that. <SEP> We've kind of exhausted everything I guess. I think we have been talking probably about four and a half minutes. And we both look forward to going to our next reunions I'm sure. <SEP> But it has been fun talking to you. You too. Thank you. <SEP> And maybe I'll talk to you again.
