Have you grown up in Dallas Stephanie? I've only been here for the last ten years. Where are you from? <SEP> I grew up most of my childhood in Germany. In Germany. And. <SEP> We took a lot of vacations while we were there because everything was within driving distance. There's a place I'd like to visit. So we travelled all over Europe. When I was very young. Unfortunately a little bit too young to really appreciate. That's neat. <SEP> I was grade school age. My husband took a bicycle tour about five months right after the second world war. And so we've seen lots of pictures of the beautiful spots and areas. <SEP> That would be to me a really nice vacation because I'm not in physical shape for something like that but I sure would work on it if I had an opportunity like that. Y-. <SEP> <SEP> that's neat. What kind of vacations do you like? My husband and I are scuba divers. H-. <SEP> So we both like to go to dive resorts. We went to Hawaii on our honeymoon. And we dove there. But we did about six dives while we were there. And we were originally planning on going to Cayman last year. <SEP> But we weren't able to get enough people together for the trip. We had to have eleven people for this package deal. <SEP> And we couldn't get enough people together to go. So it ended up falling through. <SEP> We were going to get a really good price. When our children were younger we lived up in New Jersey and used to like traveling into upstate New York and camping. <SEP> And we had a little collapsible sailboat and liked to sail and that sort of thing. But we've never really did any diving or anything. Little bit of water skiing. Snorkeling? <SEP> But not much of anything else. <SEP> My husband and I both like water. So any vacation that we go on is usually close to the ocean or something like that. It's got to be the water. <SEP> When we were in Jersey we used to go down to the Jersey beach a lot and really enjoyed that a lot. They had a really nice beach areas there. <SEP> After we moved away from Germany we moved to New Hampshire. <SEP> And I lived there for seven years. I see. And I really enjoyed that because the mountains were real close. That's a really pretty area too. <SEP> We like the white mountains. And unfortunately I didn't really get to go skiing much while I was there. <SEP> I went skiing once. We loved the New Jersey area too because the lakes were really pretty close. You could drive within twenty minutes to an hour and just be at a real nice vacation spot where you could sail and just really. And then we weren't too for from the Appalachian Trail. We did quite a bit of hiking. Which is kind of fun. Are you a hiker or not? <SEP> Not so much? Not really so much. If there was some place that we went to where there was hiking involved I would be happy to go hiking. <SEP> But we never have really planned a vacation around places to go hiking. So your plans are try to find someplace to scuba dive. Our next vacation will be scuba diving. I'm sure. You have any children? <SEP> Not yet. Then that's probably one of the reasons our. We had little children all the time. So some of the things are not quite as adaptable. <SEP> It's a little more difficult planning a vacation when you have children. It is. You have to try to figure out kinds of things that you can do that they will enjoy too. And. <SEP> So I think wha-. And diving is something that. Especially for small children. I think the minimum age for diving would be probably about sixteen. <SEP> Eleven or twelve I would think probably. But maybe fifteen even. I know that one thing that happens to vacation trips now is that usually that try to involve some of the members of the family. We go wherever somebody is that we haven't seen for a while. <SEP> So that's kind of. We just came back from Grand Rapids where we saw one of our sons graduate with his Master's Degree in social work. And so that was fun. And the summer we have a reunion in Salt Lake area up by Park Cities. Where we're going to camp for a week with as many members of a rather large reunion group as we can get together. <SEP> So. That sounds like a lot of fun. Ye-. <SEP> Our family had a reunion last year that was kind of like that too. That there were several hundred people. And they all kind of met at a central place. I didn't go. <SEP> But. It would have been a nice vacation. We've moved around enough so that we now have people in different parts of the country. I guess my favorite vacation idea would be to somehow figure out something kind of mobile where you could stop and sleep maybe like a small camper. We've travelled in a big one. I hate them because they're hard to jockey around. But maybe a pickup with the back on. <SEP> Or something like the Volkswagen Vanagon. I've heard is really nice. So you could kind of sleep in it sometimes. But you wouldn't want to do it all the time. <SEP> We have enough friends here and there. I would just love to just drive through the United States and stop and see people I know and visit for a day and then go on and. <SEP> My dad has been talking for years about getting a fifth wheel and just picking up. He's retired. <SEP> He's in his sixties. And he would like to just get a fifth wheel and just travel across the country and spend a month here or a couple of weeks there and just not be settled anywhere. <SEP> I think that would real. Just see the rest of the country. And I would like to maybe not take great long trips but have your home base where your home is and then just travel out for maybe a month maybe go. <SEP> He does that quite a bit. And. <SEP> He hasn't lately though because he's been ill. But he's been known to be gone for a month or two at a time. And he'll say this is my itinerary. I'm going here here and here. And I'll be back in about two months. There are a lot of neat places to visit in America. That's for sure. I haven't been much to the south. I haven't been in Georgia or Florida or Mississippi or Alabama. I guess those are the only states I have not visited. But up the coast in Maryland and around there where the early history is there's some. Johnstown and in that area is just really neat. Interesting things to. So. <SEP> Have you been to a lot of the different historical sites? We took a trip around to the Civil War battle grounds and things back in nineteen sixty when it was the centennial or something. <SEP> I believe it was. Had about three kids then I think. But that was a really fun interesting trip. We read Bruce book before we went. And so we were ready to look up the places we read about. I think right now while my husband and I don't have any kids we'll probably take as many vacations as we can doing things like scuba diving and adventurous types of things. It was really interesting. <SEP> <SEP> And then eventually when we have kids. His folks did a lot of traveling across country. They went to the Grand Canyon and did things like that. Camping is fun with kids. If you're. <SEP> Once they get a little bigger not teeny tiny ones. But even some little ones do pretty good. But when they get a little bigger they can help. That's a fun way to cut costs. And it's enjoyable too. Very restful. I find. <SEP> I do enjoy camping. I find the outdoors very relaxing and kind of a change. As long as I have a shower nearby I'm fine. And electricity. <SEP> I'm with you. I need my creature comforts too. It was great to talk to you. <SEP> It was nice talking to you too Beth. See you later.
