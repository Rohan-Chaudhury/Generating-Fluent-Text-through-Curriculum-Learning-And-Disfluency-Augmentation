We're supposed to talk about vacations. What kind of vacations do you like? I haven't been to many places. But I have a opportunity to go to Paris France with my friend in April. Her family lives there. And she's only been there once. Her grandmother lives there. <SEP> So I'm praying I get to go. That's great. It will be probably the most exciting place I'll ever get to go. <SEP> Have you ever been to New Mexico? Actually. <SEP> Why have you? I was curious. I was just wondering what it was like. I have been to Europe once and to Haiti and. Tahiti? <SEP> Tahiti. Haiti. Haiti. <SEP> Where is that? It's in the Caribbean. And it's the western half of an island. With the eastern half that's the Dominican Republic. <SEP> And I was down there with a program from the college that I went to where we would just spend three months in a foreign country most of them third world countries. And study the language and then do a little service project. <SEP> That turned out to be a really good experience for me. What did you do when you were in Europe? I went there when I was in high school actually. <SEP> And I mostly went to Germany and visited some friends of my family and hung out with them worked a bit on one of their farms and also went to a youth camp. What did you do on the farm? Not that much. Just. Are you just kind of. <SEP> I wasn't a great asset to them or anything. But I drove a tractor helped them weed beets and that sort of thing. <SEP> And I went to a youth camp that included working at an old people's home. And that was pretty interesting. And while I was there I visited my aunt and uncle who were staying for their vacation in France in Nantes which is on the west coast right across from England. Where in France are you. Paris. <SEP> Paris. And how long do you plan to be going for? Two weeks. Last time she stayed two months. But we're only going to stay two weeks. <SEP>. And. We're going to take a cooking class there. So that might be fun. <SEP> A what? Cooking class. French cooking. <SEP> And what else are you planning to do if anything? Museums. Go to museums and. Do you go to museums in Europe? <SEP> Actually. I don't think I went to any of them. The closest thing I did was go to some restored castles and stuff. There is some on that west coast of France. And I went to a vineyard or two in Germany. That's neat. <SEP> That was nice. So. What about. Have you ever been to Hawaii? I haven't. <SEP> Have you? <SEP> I'm wanting to go there. Where have you gone first? Where have I gone that's anywhere. <SEP>
