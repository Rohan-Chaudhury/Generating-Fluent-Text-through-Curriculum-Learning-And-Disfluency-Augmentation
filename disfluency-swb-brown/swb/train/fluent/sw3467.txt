I said Arlington Texas because the other day I was talking with somebody. And he was in Arlington Virginia. That's the only one I've got now for this area. <SEP> Anyway we've got a easy subject. We do. You go ahead first if you'd like. <SEP> Let me think here. Favorite. I haven't been watching much T V lately. You get so busy. <SEP> I used to. I have one favorite soap opera. I still watch. And I tape because I'm not home. <SEP> And let's see. That's GENERAL HOSPITAL. And then at night when I sit down I don't usually sit down till almost nine o'clock when my kids get in bed. I know. And then I watch. What do I watch at nine o'clock. Let's see. Tuesday nights I guess we try to catch a couple of the shows that the kids like. <SEP> And. Are they little? I have a seven year old and a ten year old. They're pretty young. <SEP> So we usually catch FULL HOUSE. And what's the one comes on after that. It's a new one. I don't know. My kids are older. So I don't know some of those shows now like I used to. <SEP> Other than that. I watch KNOTS LANDING on Thursday nights for pure entertainment nothing else. <SEP> I like the comedies. They're just light too. I have to watch MURPHY BROWN. I really like. Now that is a good one. I make a point of that. <SEP> That is. If I'm home on Mondays then I definitely watch her. I love that. And I really like COACH. I think when it's good it's just a scream. <SEP> He's a good actor. He really is good. He's probably playing himself. Half the time you see these people on an interview show they act just like they do in their parts. He. I saw him on JOHNNY CARSON once. And he acted about the same. <SEP> He could very well be. And. Do you watch much T V. Or. I watch more now because I had been going to school for years and have really been too busy. <SEP> But this semester I'm only taking one course. And so I see MURPHY BROWN and COACH and THE WONDER YEARS. I just make a point of seeing those. I never see that. I've got a friend that says that is just wonderful show. It's fabulous. Really you should never miss that. They are just gems of shows. They really fabulous in every way. <SEP> Nice. What night is that on now? That's Wednesday at seven thirty. <SEP> Wednesday at seven thirty. Wednesdays I go to church choir. So. That's my one night out and about. So. Maybe your husband could tape it for you sometime. <SEP> I should get him to do that. Because I know. Just so you get the idea. It Wouldn't take much to get hooked on those. <SEP> I watch those. Are there any new ones this year that came out that you like. Or. I haven't. We started watching NORTHERN EXPOSURE. It's not really new. But it's still kind of new. <SEP> How's that? I haven't seen that. I like it a lot. It's real different. In fact they never thought it would be a hit. They'll have some things in there almost supernatural or something. Somebody will see a figure from the past that nobody else does. Or it sounds weird. But it's very unique show and very well done. <SEP> Excellent actors. I'll have to watch for that. I guess we just. It came on after something we used to watch. <SEP> And I guess we just kept sitting there. And now we make a point of watching. I can't take all these shows on because next semester I'm not going to be able to watch hardly any television. Then it will be mostly reruns I guess. <SEP> And by the end of February the way they do it nowadays. We used to watch a lot of DESIGNING WOMEN. But. <SEP> But I haven't seen that much lately. Since they got rid of Delta Burke and brought on the new ones. I've seen that. <SEP> Was she the best one? Was she the best one on that old show? <SEP> She was just funny. She was really funny. And her character was good. I don't know that it was her in particular but just the character. <SEP> So. They had a big fight on that show didn't they? They were all accusing each other of everything in the world. <SEP> That was awful. And who knows still what really happened. I know. You never will probably. So. I think the latest soap opera for people is the Kennedy trial for those who have cable. <SEP> I know. I don't have cable. I told. We don't have that station either. So I haven't been able to catch any of that. But just what little we caught on the news. It's just as wild as any soap opera from what I hear on the news. <SEP> I know it. And I think he's guilty as the devil. I don't see how he couldn't be. I know. What's in it for her. There's never anything for you to go to trial as a witness in a case like that. Because you know they tear you to shreds especially those rich high powered lawyers. <SEP> That's right. And they said this lawyer is unbelievable. <SEP> But they said she held up so well yesterday. I know. Everybody was saying that. And then in the paper said it. So It should be interesting. <SEP>. The NATIONAL ENQUIRER says. <SEP> I was reading that in the supermarket line. I never have the nerve to buy the thing. Do you watch any sports or anything like that. Says he. <SEP> Or. I don't care anything about that. Because I don't either. I can't watch it on T V. So. I like the ice skating. Occasionally some ice skating will come on on a Sunday or during the Olympics. <SEP> I always watch that. I think it's so beautiful. I like to catch the gymnastics sometimes too. That's good.
