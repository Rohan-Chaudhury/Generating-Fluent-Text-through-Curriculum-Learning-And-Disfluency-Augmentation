So what kind of home repair work have you done? Done a little repair on the shingles on the roof recently. We've had a lot of wind around here. Been pulling them up or just loosening them until the rain came in? <SEP> It looks like I'm going to have to get up there again because we may have a leak. Are you in the section of Texas that's been getting so much rain? We've been getting quite a bit maybe not quite as bad as some of the folks down around San Antonio. But I'm right. Plano's just north of Dallas. <SEP> And there are parts of downtown or near downtown Dallas that are under water right now I guess. I saw on the news. But you're probably about halfway across the state from San Antonio though aren't you? We're north and about eighty to a hundred miles south of the Oklahoma line I guess. <SEP> But you're still getting a good bit of the rain though. We did have a little bit of rain yesterday. So far we haven't had any today. And I suppose that means I should be getting up there to look at that shingle. But I had something else planned today. <SEP> So I guess I'll let it go awhile. Is it asphalt shingles. Or. They're. They're wood shake. That should be a lot of fun. <SEP> Did you put them up originally or just going up and stopping leaks in them? I. As a matter of fact we've never had a leak actually yet. This. We just bought the house last year. And just before we took possession of it we had a fellow go up there and do whatever needed to be done on the shingles. So I've just recently had to start looking at it myself. <SEP> So it's a small problem so far. But I guess you just have to keep on top of it. What kind of roof do you have? We're in campus apartment buildings with flat top. Then you don't have to do too much with it. Not too much. They're just tar and gravel treated flat top roofs. <SEP> Have you got pretty well pitch on that roof or is it pretty steep? It's pretty steep. Parts of it are steeper than others. What do you use to keep from sliding off that rascal? <SEP> You wear shoes with good traction and try to remember where you are at all times. I imagine I imagine. And remember to yell Geronimo if all else fails. <SEP> That would be just too much of a fall for me. Have you been. Was the house reasonably new. Or you been doing some remodeling work on it. It's actually just twelve years old now. That's pretty new house yet. <SEP> It. This part of the country. Actually they say that when the house is fifteen it's already old. But just take good care of it. Thing is. The main thing that we've had with this house recently has been some squirming of the foundation. We're just on a concrete slab. <SEP> But the soil right under this is a clay. And it. It's settling unevenly? Depending on its moisture content it either swells up or shrinks. And of course the soil right under the slab retains its moisture a lot longer. <SEP> And so during the dry season you have to water the foundation to keep your foundation from drooping. <SEP> But anytime there's a change in the weather like drastic changes in temperature or in moisture you get little spider web cracks all around windows and doors. That sounds like a lot of fun. Usually what you do is just wait until you think it's stopped. And then you patch them up. What is it stucco walls or. <SEP> It's all drywall. Drywall. I think with. Wood framing? <SEP>. But somehow or other that does manage to show these little cracks. I don't know quite how that works. Maybe it isn't drywall. I don't really know. They plastered over drywall. <SEP> I think it is. I remember my parents home is drywalled and then almost like a small grade stucco type plastering over the drywall to give it a textured sort of a look. I expect that's what it is. And made for kind of a hard shell on the drywall. <SEP> I think that's the way this is done. Fortunately we haven't had any real big holes in it yet. So I. That's good. That would be terribly terribly exasperating to have the slab floor swelling and giving like that. The previous owner had a major problem with it because probably a variety of things. His neighbor used.
