How long have they been recycling there in Virginia? Actually quite a while. I've lived here for six years. And can you hold on just a second? <SEP>. I'm sorry. I must have got the other line cut off. So they've been doing it for a while now. <SEP> And it. I live in an apartment. And my facilities. There it is. Hold on. <SEP> Sorry about that. You're okay. <SEP> They have facilities here in my apartment complex for recycling paper only. I've been recycling for maybe about two years now and at another public facility where they have recycling of glass aluminum and paper. Have you recycled plastic also? <SEP> And that's what I don't understand exactly why they don't have that option. We have out here up until just this last year in on you are town there wasn't any really good way. They had some bends around that we could find and put them in. <SEP> But not all that many. It wasn't very well advertised. But recently the refuse department is working on getting a system going where we will actually have a bend that we put things in for recycling these other things. <SEP> So it should be good. I think it's a marvelous idea when I just think of the papers that I dump out. <SEP> There just. It's such a. I waste. I just hate to think about it. An additional thing is. Where I work they also have recycling there of all white paper and of cans also. <SEP> So a lot of people right at the vending machines they have receptacles that you can just pop your cans in. <SEP> And near the Xerox machines they have places for your paper. <SEP> I keep a little box at my desk. <SEP> And as I'm using the white paper I just throw it right in there. And then they have someone that comes around and pick it up every afternoon which is an excellent idea at work because I know the amount paper they go through there. That's neat. <SEP> Because. That's right. I guess one of the things that needs to happen is we need to be better informed about it. <SEP> There's needs to be more public service programs or something that would let us know had happens to it and helps us to become enthused about it because of what is happening. I would agree with that. <SEP>. And there's. <SEP> I've seen a few things but not very much really. And I think that's a shame. They need to do a little more. I'd like to know for instance when they say plastic all plastic what kind of plastic can you put all together or is there some reason not to. <SEP>. Maybe they just sort it after they get it and throw out what they can't use. I don't know. <SEP> But I'd be glad to organize it if they'd tell me what it is I'm doing because that would be really helpful. <SEP> I agree with you there. Another thing that I like here which is. I do with. I have to actually go to two different recycling areas because one of them is that. Their aluminum cans is for Children's Hospital for a burn fund. <SEP> So all the monies are donated for the recycling to Children's Hospital which I think is an excellent idea there because the other public. That's great. <SEP> That gives you a little bit of incentive there. <SEP> And before even at work. Before they started the recycling plan which at work they've only been doing since January first of this year I had had everyone in my department recycling. And I would have them drop their cans off in my office. Saving them for you. <SEP> And then I would haul them here to this place for the Children's Hospital Fund which got people really going into it. I think that's right. <SEP> But. I think helping us be more enthusiastic about it helping us maybe using the money for something special that would be like paying off the national debt. <SEP> That. There you go. Making sure. <SEP> That's for sure. But I think that's. I think there needs to be a little bit more in the area of advertisement and letting you understand more of what it is you're doing why you're doing it how it's done and what happens to it because I think that would help a lot. <SEP>. <SEP> And I'm sure in the near future I would think they would be coming out with more. I've seen a definite trend towards more recycling everywhere even at McDonald's with their use of no foam containers anymore. I. <SEP> I'm glad to see some of these things I think. <SEP> I think it is getting more advertisement. People are becoming more conscience all the time that it's necessary to do and that we need to somehow get away from the fact that we have to have everything individually wrapped. <SEP>. And all these things that. <SEP> I think that's true. I think. That's about my some on recycling. But I enjoyed talking to you. <SEP> I did too.
