Being a former drug user. I guess I have to say at this point that I do approve of it. <SEP> Because I know that in using drugs I was not a good employee. And so I can see from the company's standpoint that there. Whenever you are an employee of the company you are using its assets. You are also under their liability under the Workmen's Comp. <SEP> On my job we had a lot of Workmen's Comp cases. And I work for a tire company Modern Tire. Where do you work? <SEP> And it's also a retreading plant. And that's where most of our injuries occur. And what we do is we'll have a drug test if a man has an accident. Then he's automatically given a drug test. <SEP> Do they do it within hours of the accident. Or is it? When he goes to the doctor the first time. And so that kind of. I don't know if it's been a deterrent or not because we have just started using it for the past year or so. <SEP>. We've let some people go that we found that drugs were used in their system. I don't know how T E C would handle it. They haven't pursued it. <SEP> If there's some problem I know. There was one guy that we tested for preemployment for drugs who absolutely swore up and down that it showed that he was using amphetamines. And he went to a separate drug testing firm. And they showed it negative. <SEP> So I think the tests themselves are not really that cut and dried. <SEP> I think that's probably true too. That's sort of scary. And then I also had a friend who was just around some people that were smoking cocaine. And he tested positive on cocaine. You always wonder is he just saying that. <SEP>. That's a bad situation. I think most companies now as far as entry exams require that. <SEP> I think they should. <SEP> I'm a T I employee. And I'm really gung ho for it. In fact I. Some of the places now like I B M don't allow them smoking in the plant. <SEP> We have designated smoking areas. <SEP> But I work in sort of a building that's not really. It's on the campus of the T I facility. But it's a little bit separated. We lease the building. And it's a factory environment. And they have designated smoking. But it's just wide open. It's not ventilated properly. <SEP> And I think that's bad. But as far as the drugs being in the factory kind of environment that way I think it's essential. Because you're endangering everybody's lives if it's something like that. <SEP> In fact we've had the policy on just the random testing now for a couple years. <SEP> And I was giving my boss a hard time because I kept waiting for my name to come up. They never called me. They never. And finally the day we declared war was my time. You're kidding. <SEP> And my boss has gone for about three times I think. And I told him he's obviously in a high risk group. The executives? And of course they did specifically single them out when we started that they were going to do all them first. <SEP> The executives? Wouldn't that be awful if you were using and lose your job and everything. <SEP> Which I thought was interesting. <SEP> I can't believe I was so brazen before. Like I say I'm a former drug user. But I accepted Christ as my Lord and Savior. And so I don't use drugs any more. <SEP> What kind of drugs did you use if you don't mind? Marijuana cocaine and amphetamines. <SEP> And all on the job too. It had gotten that bad. <SEP> It's really lucky that you got away from that. Cause that's really downward spiral. It's. Life is so much more enjoyable. <SEP> And I was losing jobs just from doing a poor job. That's it. There's all kinds of drawbacks much less the drug testing. <SEP> Just life in general. That's right. I'm definitely for it. <SEP> Plus you want to think that you're working with people who are not only putting out their fair share but that are not endangering your life. That's right. In some cases. <SEP> My husband several years back worked for Motorola. And they had. It was a chemical handling type. <SEP> And they have some serious chemicals out there. They have emergency shower where you just run in there and strip off and dump water that kind of thing. <SEP> And they had people out there using all sorts of drugs handling those chemicals. And that's really frightening. <SEP> So I think some places like that it should be mandatory on a greater frequency than maybe just paper pushers like I am. <SEP> I would think there would be. You'd think so. But. But they weren't? <SEP> I don't know if they do it till yet. Isn't that awful. Because when he was at. Course now it's been years now because it was even before they had the designated smoking type stuff at T I. <SEP> I forgot what. I guess it was eighty-four eighty-five something like that. And at that time they had no testing whatsoever. <SEP> So that's scary. That reminds me of. I have a friend who was telling me about her brother who gets high all the time. And I have just casually asked her what he did for a living. And she said he's the supervisor of this chemical land fill where they go and dump all this toxic stuff. <SEP> And I just went where? Should we move? Let me move as far away as possible. <SEP> That's awful. But I'm proud though that I grew up in the sixties. And back then it was popular. <SEP>. But people have really become wise about drugs. <SEP> And they really have a good campaign for the young people. They know it's not smart. So I guess it was just a generational thing. <SEP> Peer group is the other way now instead of. That's right. And that's good. <SEP> That's. That's the best way to stop it. It really is. I think we did it. <SEP> It's good talking to you. I enjoyed talking to you Cathy.
