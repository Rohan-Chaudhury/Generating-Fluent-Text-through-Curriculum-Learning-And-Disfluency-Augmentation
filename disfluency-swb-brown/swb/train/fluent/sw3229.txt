While I was waiting for you to connect I thought of a couple of menus. So I decided it had to be in it informal or not. If it's informal I'd probably choose something just like hamburgers or steaks out on the grill because that's a lot of fun especially this time of year where it's so nice out. <SEP>. If it was formal I'd probably go with something like a chicken breast or lasagna or something. I'm not into formal dinner parties. But I'd probably go with lasagna a green salad and garlic bread. <SEP> I see. So what do you use for cookbooks? I have a PILLSBURY cookbook I got when I was married. But it's kind of the bible of cooking for me. <SEP> Then I have some from church that are more family recipes that are more useful. Budget cookbooks. And of course you get a lot from when you're growing up. <SEP>. I cook a lot the same as my mom did. Of course I've added several different recipes. <SEP> But what would you. I think we come from different backgrounds. So the. That's good. <SEP> I. So it diff-. Have different perspectives that you are. I find the JOY OF COOKING to be a remarkably useful book to fall back on. Because it has almost everything in it. But on the other hand it's not very inspiring. It's a good reference when you need to dig something up. <SEP> What we've found very useful is a book called THE THIRTY MINUTE COOKBOOK. By Marion Burroughs. Which has recipes which allegedly can all be prepared in thirty minutes the whole meal. <SEP> And so she's. That would be wonderful in these times. I find that the cutting up of the food and all that really makes it take a little longer than thirty minutes. Either they're really fast or. <SEP> They're interesting combinations that nobody thought of. <SEP> What's one of your favorites? The one I had most recently was one that. She describes as Jim Beard's favorite summer menu or something. And it consisted of grilled kielbasa sausage a potato salad with olive oil and some tomatoes that had been chopped up with onions and curry powder and probably some yogurt was in there. <SEP> Sounds too good. That's certain you can do in thirty minutes. <SEP> But there are a whole lot of. I would recommend you look at that book if you're a busy person. That THIRTY MINUTE COOKBOOK. THIRTY MINUTE COOKBOOK. That sounds fun. I find a lot of the cookbooks that you buy over the counter ask for really strange ingredients or things I don't keep on hand all the time. <SEP> And I have young children. And our budget's set at this time. But I want to use simple recipes that I have things on hand. I don't have to run to the store to buy or look for something I haven't heard of. <SEP> That's why sometimes I shy away from more of a traditional cookbook. But it was interesting talking to you. It's a fun subject. Food is one of my favorite things too. <SEP> Anything else you wanted to add? You had said dinner. What would I put together for a formal dinner. We had some friends over as recently as Saturday night. <SEP> And put here. The inspiration was a combination of Julia Child for the dessert a chocolate mousse recipe and a sort of cookbook which has a recipe for a thing called chicken marabella which is this wonderful thing you can do. That's good. <SEP> Basically you're baking chicken in an open pan having marinated it first. And my wife did this part so I don't remember all the details. Marinated in olive oil and some seasoning and cooked with some olives and some prunes. There's a little bit of brown sugar in there. And it bakes up. And it's a delicious thing. And it's easy. That sounds good. <SEP> Comparatively. So. I'm sorry. That sounds really good. I just love. It sounds like you guys are a little more gourmet than I am. I'm pretty simple right now. But. <SEP> Maybe a little more leisure time to do it. I don't know. That's true. I have little ones. And they won't eat too many different foods right now. <SEP> I found my kids were very frustrating when they were little in terms of their tastes. <SEP> There again sometimes it was easy. They'd. Canned ravioli was one of their favorites and so it was easy to open a can of ravioli. <SEP> Spaghetti's a pretty staple every other week or so. <SEP> And it goes a long ways too. Nice talking to you Cheryl. <SEP> Talk to you later maybe.
