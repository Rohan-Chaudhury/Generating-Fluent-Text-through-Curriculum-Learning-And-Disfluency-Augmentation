. Do you live in a home? <SEP> It's a house we bought about two and a half years ago now. Did you? <SEP> First house. We've lived in ours for about six years. We had it built actually. And it's our first home too. <SEP>. So what do you think of owning a home as opposed to renting somebody else's? Before we built our home we were managing some apartments that we were living in. <SEP> And that was quite an experience. I much prefer having my own home and just the space and more privacy. <SEP>. Is it a fairly large house? It's twenty-four fifty square feet. <SEP> That's pretty good size. It's a two story. How about yours? <SEP> It's tiny. Is it small? It's not much bigger. Actually we had an two bedroom apartment that was about as big as this house is. So. <SEP> It's only eleven hundred square feet. Do you have children? Just one. Just one. <SEP>. But all the rooms are small. But it ends up giving us three bedrooms which we wanted. And. Use an extra one for an office which is handy. <SEP> I'd rather have more rooms and less space in each one I guess. Rather have lots of rooms and lots of space. But that ends up costing me. <SEP> How does it compare to the ones in your neighborhood? It's pretty typical it's a very very middle class neighborhood. Lots of young couples with usu-. I'm sure that virtually everybody in the neighborhood that's their first homes. <SEP> And lots of kids and stuff. And so it fits well in the neighborhood. It's certainly not a real upscale neighborhood. But on the other hand it's clean and kind of suburban little bit more than I want. <SEP> Is yours also pretty much in conformance with the neighborhood. It seems about probably average. <SEP> Or is it? But our neighborhood has just a wide variety of people. And there's older people here and people that are our age. We're in our thirties. <SEP> And there's a lot of kids. People across the street have eight. Eight kids? <SEP> Their home just burned down matter of fact last summer. And they're just rebuilding. And their house is going to be really big. It's. <SEP> I'm sure with eight. They're building a lot bigger. He's not an obstetrician an orthopedic surgeon. So since the house did burn they're going. It's quite different than it was before. And it's a lot bigger. <SEP>. But ours is about. It's a nice home. It's definitely not one of the smaller ones. And it's not the biggest either. But. <SEP> New ones they tend to be real tiny especially in newer neighborhoods. My brother just built a new house. He lives in Wichita Kansas. And the neighborhood actually fought him on it. Because the house was going to cost less to build than any other house in the neighborhood. That's because he's doing a lot of it himself for example landscaping and lots of the other stuff. <SEP> And his house actually ended up being nicer than lots in the neighborhood. But they were pretty touchy on it. You. He was a little surprised. That's interesting. You say that because we have those architectural codes here. <SEP> And when we put out house in they wanted us to have. There was one. We have part siding on the two story part and then on the back. <SEP> And there was one side where our chimney was. And just the chimney was going to be brick. And they wanted us to have more brick. So we ended up having to go halfway up. It does look nicer. And we would have like to have had all brick. But of course at that point we couldn't afford it. But it's funny that you'd say that because there were homes in here that didn't have any brick at all. <SEP> So it's kind of like they were. Kind of depends on when they get in. And so it was kind of like they. Ours is the last street that they built on. So the houses actually on our street they're kind of gone a little bit nicer. <SEP> They have. It's gotten. Just they. It's the second phase. <SEP> And so they've kind of changed the codes a little bit. And so that's kind of why they stuck us with more brick when there were other homes that didn't have any. <SEP> My sister kind of got in the opposite end of that because they moved into a neighborhood and bought a real nice stone house down in South Austin. And what the builder apparently plans to do is they do phase one. And they kind of give it a very upscale and very tightly controlled codes and stuff. And then they come back in. And then they sell.
