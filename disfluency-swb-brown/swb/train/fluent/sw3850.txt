. What are your favorite shows? I like watching COLOMBO and MATLOCK and QUANTUM LEAP. <SEP>. QUANTUM LEAP? <SEP> Did you see it the other night? That was pretty good. That one was. What about. <SEP> What do you. With the psychic and everything? I like NORTHERN EXPOSURE and HOME IMPROVEMENT. I haven't seen either of those. <SEP> You've never seen NORTHERN EXPOSURE? It's a great show. I also like to watch STAR TREK. But it's on so late here that I don't always get to see it. <SEP> We like it too. Have you seen the movie? I haven't seen any of the movies because I just barely just in the last year or so got interested in it. And they're already out with number six by now. So I haven't seen any of the movies yet. But I. You haven't seen any of them. <SEP> They're good. They're real good. They're getting rid of the old cast for the movies though. Which ones are you watching the new ones? I've seen quite a few of the older ones. I haven't seen really the new generation that much. <SEP>. Is there one you prefer better the older one or the newer one? They're a lot different. But I like the older ones because at that time they were really futuristic. <SEP> And I guess the newer ones are real futuristic too. But I like both of them. I do too. I have a brother-in-law who really likes the old ones a lot. He almost hates the new ones. Because he thinks the newer ones is like a soap opera and the other one isn't or something. But I don't. <SEP> Not really. It's not really like a soap opera. I think. <SEP> But it's. But that's true. You learn more about the characters and stuff. But that's the way all shows are now. Let's see. I like to watch COLOMBO because it's like a mystery thing. That's sort of how Matlock is. But COLOMBO is way tricky. <SEP> He doesn't even try to let the person know he's getting onto them. It seems like they always show COLOMBO the same ones over and over though like that one where he goes to college. Did you see the one. <SEP> Or is there a series on. There's one on. We see it Thursdays at seven. And it was. <SEP> This last time it was about this movie director. Did you hap-. I saw that one. Did you see that? <SEP> That was a rerun. I guess I nev-. I wondered if that's. <SEP> I don't know if that's the movie of the week or what. But it seems like there's only about four or five different ones. And then they keep showing them over and over. I guess I haven't seen it before. He was a movie director. And he had that gal killed. <SEP> On the set or something. That was pretty good though. It was. But. I like COLOMBO probably the best of any of those mystery things. <SEP> But there's never anything good on Saturdays though. No kidding. I don't think so. STAR TREK'S on at five. But I'm never home. So. <SEP> What is it that. There's something I watch on Saturdays. And I can't remember what it is. I used to watch TWIN PEAKS. You never saw that? I've heard of it a lot. I've heard of. A lot of people somehow or something. They'll say so and so from TWIN PEAKS or something. <SEP> That was a different soap opera. But it was a different type of show. <SEP> I didn't like the way it ended though. Did they end the whole series? <SEP> They only did it for two years. But it's all over now. Another show I like to watch is MASH.
