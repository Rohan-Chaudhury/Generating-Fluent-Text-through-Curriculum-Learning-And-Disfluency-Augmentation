I suppose we both have credit cards. They seem to be a part of life. <SEP> How do you use them? I do use them. I have a few favorites that I use more than others. And I try to keep my balances fairly reasonable. I could probably pay them off any month if I wanted to. <SEP> But occasionally they can get out of hand and get higher when you start using more than a few. And they all can build up. <SEP> I think they're handy. I just get. I don't carry a lot of cash with me. And I hate writing checks when you go shopping. <SEP>. Do you use credit cards? <SEP> I use a few. I watched my grandmother go into debt on them. And so I've. And then I guess my mother. Grandmother. <SEP> So my mother learned from that. And I guess she taught me to be very very careful with them. So basically I just keep them. I use them so that I build up a credit rating. <SEP> But otherwise I generally. And my husband. I've just been married seven months. But he has the same habit. And we just keep a few of the major ones and then use them once in a while for something. That's good. But we always pay it off right that month so that we don't pay any service charge. That's wonderful. <SEP> So that way we keep out of debt. And we keep on top of what we're spending. The interest rates in credit cards is so high now compared to what your savings is bringing. <SEP> It's really ridiculous to let them keep building. That's what I feel. So. But I know some people can get carried away with them and let them get out of hand. <SEP> It's really easy just to forget that you charged that or charged that. I try to keep all my receipts and keep them in someplace where I know that the bill's going to come. But sometimes I forget. And so a bill will come in. And I'll think I didn't know it was going to be that high. <SEP> But so far we've been able to pay it off every time. So. That's good. Right now I'm kind of looking for a Visa that has a lower interest rate. It seems that some of them have gotten higher. <SEP> And I saw on T V they had a program on credit cards. And they're supposed to. I don't know if it was Tennessee or Arkansas or some other state had a Visa card that was the lowest one in the country. And I didn't write it down at the time. And then I went and looked to see what my visa was. And I think it's eighteen percent or something. <SEP> So think I want to find something that has a lower rate. <SEP> Have you ever used Discover card? I haven't. I'm not even sure what their interest rate is since I pay it off. But you know. Is that the one from Sears? <SEP> I think Sears originally put it out. But it's pretty well taken all over the U S now. I've haven't found many places that don't take Discover. And there's no annual service fee which is good. <SEP> And then they also give you cash back at the end of the year. For the amount that I charge I get two dollars back or something. But if you use credit cards a lot you probably get more back. They give you money back for using your credit card. <SEP> Basically. That's it. I didn't know that. <SEP> And I think the service charge is pretty low too. But I'm not sure. Sears was one of the few department stores that never would take any other credit cards. I worked at Sears for over ten years. And it was only a Sears card that they would take until I guess they decided to join the club and come up with another credit card that was accepted. <SEP>. So now they'll take the Discover. But I still don't know if Sears will take Visa or Mastercard. <SEP> But I never did apply for a Discover card. I just figure with the Visa and American Express I probably have an. <SEP> I can do enough damage with those two. I think it's best to keep the number down that you have. <SEP> I've got some that I haven't even used at all past few years. I probably wouldn't be able to use them. <SEP> But I do like my Dillard's. I have to admit that's one of my favorite places to shop. And I do use Dillard's probably more than any of the other department stores. <SEP> But. Do you have anything else to say? <SEP> Not too much more about credit cards. I don't think I do either. So. <SEP> It was good talking to you. Good talking to you Beth. Good luck. <SEP> Have a good evening. You too.
