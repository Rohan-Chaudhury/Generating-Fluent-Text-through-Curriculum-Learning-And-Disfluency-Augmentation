What vacations have you been on that you like? I really enjoyed. I went to Mackinaw Island a few years back. <SEP> It's in the middle of Michigan. And so that was nice. I like driving to different cities because of the scenery. So that was nice. So you. Most of yours is kind of driving. And. <SEP> I've been all over the states except for pretty much east. It's very pretty driving up north in Wisconsin too. How far do you usually end up driving. The furthest I drove was probably Texas. And then I've taken a train before to California. You're from where? Wisconsin. <SEP> Kenosha Wisconsin. I have a brother in Minnesota that used to live in Wisconsin. <SEP> So. That's quite a ways. It is. I've. We went to California this last year and liked it. <SEP> But it was too crowded. Walt Disney World and other places it's just the wrong time of the year to go. <SEP> And course you get in any of those tourist traps and everything's outrageously priced. And kind of. You wonder if it's really worth it to pay thirty-five dollars or forty dollars just to get in. <SEP> But There's lots of fun places to see. That's true. I think the scenery kind of. That's something do to you like to get up in mountains. Or. <SEP> Do you have any mountains nearby? Pretty flat isn't it? <SEP> I think the biggest limitation is a lot just time and money isn't it. <SEP> What vacation have you enjoyed the most? Probably when we go to Wisconsin. It's pretty fun. There's a lot to do up there. It's pretty busy though. You have to like crowds. What is it? <SEP> It's a huge amusement park they have water slides. <SEP> And it's just a big big tourist attraction. The downtown is all little shops and candy shops. And it's really neat. I don't think hardly anybody lives there. Because it's just kind of tourists. Probably a city in itself kind of? It's mostly a summer place. Summer place. How far away is it? <SEP> From Kenosha it's about three hours. It's about a hour away from Madison. <SEP> So that's nice. It's a pretty ride up there too. I really like the city Wausau in Wisconsin. It's really pretty. It's nice out there. I like all the nature things there are to look at. And you can probably. You're in a climate that's kind of humid. So you have probably a lot of green and lot of real pretty things. Our climate's real dry. <SEP> Where is that? And you have to kind of get up into the mountains to get much of the greenery. Most of the land's pretty brown. You don't have as much of the greenery like you have. Where's that? Idaho is where I live. And. <SEP>. It's by. I have a little baby thinks he needs to cry now that I'm on the phone. <SEP> It's by Boise. You ever heard of Boise? And it's fine. It's nice. It's uh lot different kind of. I lived in Indiana for a while. And it's a real different land and scenery than there. It's kind of fun to have a little bit diversity and things like that. <SEP> I think there's a lot of places down even in southern Utah the canyon lands and Bryce Canyon. And they're gorgeous. <SEP> Those are kind of fun places. We usually go over to Bear Lake in the summer which is kind of on the border of Idaho and Utah. And the lake goes on forever. And that's real pretty over there too. But I think I'm kind of a summer vacationer. <SEP> Me too. Me too. Unless I'm going somewhere warm for the winter. <SEP> That'd be nice. Where'd you.
