Do you vote regular? I do I try and vote in every single election. Every one. <SEP> But that's just in the past about six years. Before that I really didn't pay any attention at all. That's me. I've never paid any attention to voting. You haven't? <SEP> I didn't use to. But now I really. Because I get so angry about what goes on. And then I feel like I can't really complain too much unless. Unless you have something to do with it. <SEP> But the problem is that I am very liberal politically. And so I hardly ever have anybody that wins that I vote for. Liberal. What do you mean by liberal. Liberal politically. I'm pretty left wing Democrat. So. I don't know anything about politics. <SEP> You don't? What's the main difference between Republicans and Democrats? There's a lot of them. It depends on what issue you're talking about. But Democrats on a lot of issues are more liberal than Republicans. And it used to be it's kind of hard to say now especially after Desert Storm. But I think back in the times when my political opinions were being formed during the Vietnam war and stuff the Republicans were more what they called Hawks which is more aggressive in war and more pro war and pro aggression. <SEP> And the Democrats were the Doves. They were more for peace. And I'm not sure how much that holds true anymore. I think the issues are. And you vote for the Democrats. Or. <SEP> Usually. And Democrats usually are more supportive of public assistance programs. <SEP> And programs to. The big Republican thing is that they vote for less government. They want less government involvement in society. And so they're less apt to vote in more aid to people. Or more they're less apt to vote in programs that involve the government running things. <SEP> Have you ever voted at all? I never have. You haven't? <SEP> How old are you? I'm twenty-six. I know I. <SEP> I don't know that much about it. I don't keep up on it. And I don't feel like I have enough knowledge on it to pick the right person. <SEP>. So that's what they need they said something to improve voting. <SEP> If they could make it easier to find out what's going on. Do you know what I mean? <SEP> To me I didn't know what would have been wrong with. I can't even remember who ran for president against Bush. I think it was that woman. Du-. Wasn't it a woman. <SEP> It was Dukakis from Massachusetts. Dukakis. Didn't he have a woman. Or was that Reagan. There was a woman that was running for vice president for a while. <SEP> That was. Ferraro. Ferraro. That was a while ago. That was a couple elections ago. <SEP> That's okay. That's what I mean. I didn't know what the difference between Dukakis and Bush was. I didn't know anything about Bush or Dukakis. <SEP> What do you think about what you see on T V about them in the news or on the ads. Do you kind of just. I don't remember anything about Dukakis. You don't? But they're all saying that they're going to do whatever is best for their campaign anyway. <SEP> That's what I mean. If they had some kind of public programs where you can just go out and. I don't know. In school they didn't teach you about the government not really. <SEP> You didn't get any government classes? <SEP> It's really hard too. Because before they used to have a lot of. It seems like the stuff that they put out now it doesn't just seem like it. I know for a fact that any kind of stuff that if you wrote and asked for material. What do you believe in. What do you believe in. They don't take any stands on anything. They kind of say what do you want me to believe. Or they word it so that it's really hard to tell where they're standing on certain issues. I'm not sure they're. I know how they do it. <SEP> It. With the abortion issues and stuff. They have to kind of take a stand on some things like abortion and things like that. So that's kind of how I judge. There's a few things where they have to say like abortion or gun control. Or let me see. I try to look at if some of the newspaper articles or the. I don't trust T V as much. But newspaper articles can show how they voted in the past. But you get. <SEP> It all depends again on who's writing it and who they're for because they can slant that too. And like I said most of the politicians I'm. Also the politicians put out what makes them look good anyway. And everybody's got stuff they don't want known. <SEP> Everybody's got a secret. So. I'm sorry. I didn't have much knowledge. That's okay. Do you think. I don't even remember this being on there. <SEP> What would it take. This is really good actually to talk to somebody who hasn't voted. What kind of. Incentive? What kind of stuff would you like them to do so that you would know more about it. Send stuff in the mail or have it at the library. Or. I guess that would be good. I'm sure they've got it at the library. <SEP>. If I get to the library. I've got two babies so I don't. <SEP> Do you? That will tie you down a little bit. But I don't know. Or do you feel like it's not really going to make that much difference if you don't vote. Or. I know if enough people think like that it would make a difference if people stopped thinking like that. <SEP>. A lot of people they'll vote the way their family votes. <SEP> Since you're Democrat? Then your kids or whatever will follow you and just vote Democrat. <SEP> Not in my family. <SEP> We're really independent. All split. But a lot of families do that. I know a lot of wives feel like they have to vote the way that their husbands vote. <SEP> And that kind of keeps from getting a lot of issues resolved. I lie. But. I don't know. If I did understand politics I probably would vote more. <SEP> But like I said if I voted for Bush. Or when Gary Hart was running a lot of women would have voted for him just because he was nicer looking. Hart? <SEP> Not that I think he was good looking. But he was young. <SEP> And then I didn't think that was right because he may have been a good president or whatever. Because it. What. He had an affair. <SEP> And it just threw him out of the whole running. And a lot of people go by their personal life when they vote. And. <SEP> Which I guess if you got turmoil in your personal life you're going to let it come into work. But I'm sure there's a lot of people that have had. <SEP> I think everybody does. It just depends on how well you can hide it. And I. That's very true. I think that doesn't really have that much to do with unless they've done something really horrible or something real abnormal. <SEP> Criminal or something like that's different. But if him and his wife weren't getting along. <SEP> But otherwise. What effect does that have on him running for president. Do you know what I mean? <SEP> It's all so secretive. We really don't see the true person anyway. That's right. <SEP> I think that's having a big effect on how poorly that the country is being run that the people that want to get elected are turning it into a popularity contest by advertising the things that really don't have anything to do with how well they do the job. But they're trying to find an excuse not to deal with the issues that people really want to know about because on those issues you have to say yes or no. And if they don't say yes or no then maybe somebody will vote for them that wouldn't have if they had come down on the wrong side. Do you know what I'm saying? <SEP> So they just try and make it a personal thing. If you remember any of the T V commercials from the last presidential campaign they all had pictures of Bush walking around with his grandchildren. And even from Reagan it looks like a McDonald's commercial. That's about what it looked like. What did you think of Reagan as a president? <SEP> I just thought he was really inept. I don't think he did anything at all. They just kind of sat him up there like a puppet. And the people that were. Do you think he won from Carter because of the hostages that were held at that time? I think that was part of it. I think there's a lot of thin- the economic problems that the country was having at the time and the recession and stuff. <SEP> People just had a picture of Carter as not being real capable. But he actually. This. I thought he was great. I thought Carter was good too. And that was. Did you? I always liked him. I thought he was great at the time. And I just couldn't get over the fact that Reagan beat him. I just couldn't believe that he got voted out. But I think I wasn't. Let's see. That's been about ten years ago? <SEP> So I was only fifteen or sixteen. But I remember Carter. And I liked him. You did? Have you heard stuff about him lately. Do you know what he's doing? I sure don't. <SEP> He is really active still politically. He's been overseas. You remember when he was in office he did a lot of stuff for the Middle East for pe-.
