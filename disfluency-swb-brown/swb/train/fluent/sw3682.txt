What kind of foods would you have? <SEP> I like to cook. I do too. But I don't like getting too awfully fancy about it just because it's too much pressure. <SEP> If I have people over for dinner I like it to be nice and relaxed. You can't enjoy it. <SEP>. And so I don't like when they arrive for me to be completely worn out. That's what. I like doing things like making lasagna just because I can have it ready and baking in the oven. <SEP> It's. Everybody just says how wonderful it is. And it's. <SEP> I. That's one of those things I got famous for in college. People would come and say would you come over and make lasagna for me. <SEP> It's I can't really give you a recipe. You'd just do it. I can just do it. <SEP> I like doing that kind of stuff. And it's fun. In fact that's what we had for a Christmas party last week. <SEP> We just had a bunch of people over. And we did lasagna and garlic bread and yummy. I like that. I do too in fact. <SEP> I'm planning a. And naturally this is appropriate because I'm planning dinner for people tomorrow night and then the next night. <SEP> So Tuesday night there'll be eight people here altogether. Actually one thing we have done quite a bit through the holidays just because it's real easy is just baked potato dinners. And have three or four couples come over. And I'll do the potatoes and butter and cheese and stuff and have everybody else just bring a couple of toppings whatever they like. <SEP> And it turns out great because you've got hot sauce and taco meat and barbecue and bacon and all that good stuff. That's fun. <SEP> But it's inexpensive. Plus it's real easy on the hostess because you can just have the potatoes ready and just have a salad with it. And you got a great dinner. <SEP> That's a good idea. It's real easy. I like doing that part. I'm in favor of very little clean up very little planning because we've got three or four couples that we get together with to play games. <SEP>. And it's. <SEP> We invariably end up at my house since I've got two kids. And it's fine because then I can just say. You bring this. You bring this. You bring this. We're done. <SEP> And it's pretty cool. That's good. One of my favorites is to make chicken and rice. <SEP> It's very easy to. <SEP> You don't like it? I love it. You do. I have a really easy recipe for that where you just brown the chicken. And then you put rice in the bottom of the pan. You pour bouillon or chicken broth over it. <SEP> And you put the chicken in then pour the broth over. And you can put mushrooms in if you want. And then you just. Over the uncooked rice? Over uncooked rice. <SEP> And you can either microwave it. Or do it in the oven. And it just. How neat. It fluffs up. And it's really moist. I've done it where you but cook the rice and then take a can of cream of mushroom soup or cream of chicken soup and put a little bit of white wine in it. <SEP> And every once in a while I'll slice white grapes. And I'll put in there. And that's just because I'm not a real big wine person. But I like it. It adds something to the chicken. <SEP> And then just bake it. And it makes a wonderful sauce over the rice. I'll keep that one in mind. <SEP> That was one of the first things I made for my husband because I was. I could actually find something I could cook real easy that would be sort of elegant kind of. <SEP> You can get away with it even having a semi nice dinner. <SEP> Or semi. But then I hadn't thought about doing it with uncooked rice. Just in a thirteen by nine pan. <SEP> You put in. Let's see what was it three quarters of cup of rice. Or. <SEP> It depends on. You can really vary it. But you have to put the water in proportionally. I can't remember. I think it was three quarters cup rice to two cups water two cups broth. I use that for rice. And for when I cook pasta or something I'll put a little bit of bouillon in there just to give it a little extra flavor. <SEP> Flavor. That would be good. <SEP> How long do you have to bake it? Let's see. I think it was an hour. I've done it in the microwave so often lately because it's really easy. I do microwave too a lot. <SEP> But I think it's about an hour. How long would it be in the microwave? Or maybe it's only half hour. <SEP> You just. Until the rice looks fluffy and not overdone. Before it gets overdone. <SEP> Do you just brown the chicken to get it colored. Or do you go ahead and let it cook through? <SEP> I'd let it cook just a little bit just so that the cooking goes a little faster. This is a beneficial call. I like this. <SEP> I liked your idea too there. But that one's an easy one. It's like just put in. A friend of mine makes it where she goes ahead and seasons up with the soup and the wine. Put in garlic and onion powder or chopped onions if you want to do that. However much effort you feel like putting into it. <SEP>. But it makes a great. I've got a two year old and a four year old. And they love it. <SEP> Because my daughter calls it her gravy. And she thinks it's wonderful. Good you're a picky eater if I can get you to.
