What kind of vacations do you like to take? We've been fortunate enough to take a couple of trips over to Europe. So I guess those are the types I like. <SEP> We've really enjoyed them. Where have you gone there? <SEP> We've gone to Germany Switzerland Austria Ireland and England. We've been to Germany twice. <SEP> But I guess my favorite is probably Switzerland and Ireland. I've been over there too. Where have you been? I even. Let's see. Mostly Germany and France. <SEP> I lived in France for a year and a half. So I was able. How neat. But once when I had a chance in France to go on vacation instead of travelling around France I went to Germany. <SEP> Because I've got relatives there. And I just like it there. That's neat. <SEP> But Austria I found really pretty and Switzerland. And I lived in the Alps in France. So anything in the mountains over there I just love. <SEP> How neat. Then I finally made it to England too on my way home. I lived in Africa actually. And on my way home from there. <SEP> You lived in Africa? <SEP> And unless you fly from Nairobi you have to fly through Europe on your way home. So I went to England. And I really liked it there too. <SEP> It's so expensive over there. I know. It's true. That's the one thing. <SEP> It really is. It's. I love to go over there. But it's so darn expensive to go over. Actually now you can get some really good deals flying over. But it's. <SEP> Once you're there you still have to spend money. Unless you know people. I know. Just. <SEP> Then you can stay with them. And. That helps a lot. <SEP> But. There's a lot of places in the states that we haven't even gone. <SEP> I'd like to go to Hawaii some time. And we made it. We've at least gone to the Grand Canyon and Niagara Falls. So. <SEP> Feel like we've accomplished a little bit here. I haven't. I've. Most of my vacationing in the U S has been on the West Coast. Or this summer I went to Colorado. <SEP> And I'd love to go to the East Coast during the Fall. The. It's. I've always wanted to go there. I've seen pictures. And it looks gorgeous. <SEP> We made a trip up the East Coast. It was in the summer. And it really is pretty. <SEP> It's. Both coasts are really pretty. But I love the Carolinas. It's just gorgeous over there. I haven't been anywhere on the East Coast. <SEP> I think Tennessee has been the furthest east I've been. <SEP> You'll just have to plan a vacation some time and go over there. I guess so. But there's a lot to see here. <SEP> But I just love going over to Europe because their way of life is just so different than ours. We're so fast paced here. And over there every time we'd go and eat dinner or lunch or whatever we'd always have to ask for the check. <SEP> They're so leisurely over there. <SEP> And it's kind of nice to have that. So the type of vacation you'd like. Would you go over and spend a lot of time in one place or travel to whole bunch of different places in one week? Usually a bunch of different places. Probably because you want to see everything. <SEP> See as much as you can while you're there. I know. <SEP>. How did you like Africa? I liked it. I was working in Cameroon Africa. <SEP> And it's not a place for tourists. They're not used to having tourists there. So it's. You're kind of roughing it. But I liked it. I liked it. <SEP> The people there are just very friendly. And. What type of work? I was working with an organization that does Bible translation. <SEP> So I was doing linguistic work actually travelling around finding out about languages and what they call survey work. <SEP> Find out where the languages are. So I travelled a lot around the country and met a lot of people. <SEP>. That's neat. I enjoyed it. So. <SEP> I've talked to people who have been to Africa. And they. And then of course when that movie OUT OF AFRICA came out. But I've always thought it would be neat to go on a safari over there. My cousin came over while I was there. And she came to Cameroon. And then she went over to Nairobi and took a safari around close to Nairobi in Kenya. <SEP> How neat. So she'd always dreamed of doing that too. <SEP> That's great. So. So is there any place you would try to talk me into going to? It sounds like we've been to some of the same places. <SEP> It does.
