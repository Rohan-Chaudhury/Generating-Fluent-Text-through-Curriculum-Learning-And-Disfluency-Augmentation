. I'm not. I read a lot. But I don't read a whole. I tend to read only out of a couple groups. <SEP> And I'm a big baseball fan. So I tend to read a lot of the baseball books. And. I'm a big baseball fan too. <SEP> And I read a lot of science fiction. E-. I like. I teach school. And so during the school year I just don't have time to read. And I would love to be able to read more because I enjoy it so much. But with correcting papers and two kids of my own I just don't have time. But in the summer I try to read a lot. <SEP> And of course being a woman I like romance novels and stuff like that a whole lot. I just. I really enjoy that because it's kind of a getaway type thing. So I read a lot of that. But I also love sports. And I don't have time to read in. But I do read SPORTS ILLUSTRATED during the year because my son gets that. <SEP> And but I don't read a lot of nonfiction. And I really should because there's so many self-improvement books out right now that would benefit me greatly. But I just don't. I don't really I probably should. I don't really read the self-improvement books or things like that. I'll get books on history and stuff like that that look interesting. And of course I don't ever get around to reading them. I got. I belong to Quality Paperback Book Club. <SEP> Do you? And I'll get stuff out of that. I got BATTLE CRY OF FREEDOM a couple of years ago. And I started reading and got about sixty pages into it. And it's eight hundred pages. <SEP> And it was I want to read something else for a while. It's i-. Some of those books are real tough to get into. But after you get into them they're really good. <SEP> But it's just tough to get through that first two hundred pages or so. Especially. BATTLE CRY OF FREEDOM starts off in the eighteen forties. And it's. The war wasn't until the eightee-. It's okay. And I realize these things. These things take awhile to move up. But it's hard sometimes. <SEP> It's right. That's right. I find though that when I find an author. And you don't read a lot of fiction you said. But when I find. I read a lot of science fiction. Do you? <SEP> When I find an author I really like I try to read everything they write. Because you get used to their style and you really enjoy it. That and. I do the same thing. I. There's one science fiction writer named Allen Dean Foster. <SEP> I've heard of him. He. I must have fifty or sixty books by him. Is that right? I have almost everything he's ever done. <SEP> And I know that when I get his book I'm usually going to enjoy it. So it's really. It's fun to do that. <SEP> Isn't it amazing that somebody can write that many books about science fiction? I think that's unbelievable. He does a lot of movie adaptations and things like that. Does he really? And his adaptations are usually really good. <SEP> It's funny he. The novelization of STAR WARS was list-. It was out in the stores as being by George Lucas. But it turns out that Foster actually ghost wrote it for him. Is that right? Which. When I read it I should have realized that because it had Foster's style written all over it. <SEP> Is that right? I've never read anything of his. But I've heard about him. But wouldn't you think he would. Does he get some royalties from that hopefully? I'm sure he does. <SEP> I would think he would. I'd hope so. I mean he's doing all right probably. I'm sure he is. I'm sure he is. But sometimes the more you get the more you want too. So. That's true. <SEP>. You're a baseball fan. You're aware of that kind of thing. In fact I'm a sports fan period. <SEP> We. That's why I like to read SPORTS ILLUSTRATED so much. Because there's everything in it. I had a subscription to that last year. But I'm mostly a baseball fan. So I'm not as inter-. The other stuff is interesting. But I was mostly interested in the baseball stuff. <SEP> You're probably a Baltimore fan an Oriole fan? Actually I'm a Red Sox fan more than anything. Is that right? <SEP> Boston? That's good too. But I do like the Orioles also. I'm sure you do. I'm a Ranger fan simply because I live here. <SEP> But I was. I'm not from here. I'm originally from Ohio. So I've always followed the Tigers. Because I was born and raised in Toledo. Toledo. I was in Toledo last summer. Went to a Mud Hens double header. <SEP> I love the Mud Hens. They're great. I love the name. And there was a really big article on the Mud Hens in SPORTS ILLUSTRATED last year. Y-. I saved that issue actually. <SEP> Did you? That's when I had the subscription. It was a lot of fun. <SEP> I li-. I really enjoy that team. We used to go there all the time. I used to live in Iowa too. And they have the Iowa Oaks. And we used to go to their games all the time. And. They don't exist anymore. I don't think. I know they don't. <SEP> At least not by that name. There's the Iowa Cubs. But I don't know if they play in the same location. They must have changed then. Because it used. <SEP> I haven't lived there for l-. I've been here for twelve years now. And I haven't been back to Des Moines in a long time. But we used to always go to their games. And it was kind of fun. It's almost more fun than going to a major league game. I don't know. I just really enjoy the farm teams. I. Minor league baseball is a lot more fun than major league baseball. <SEP> <SEP> it is. It's not quite so serious. And it's a lot cheaper. That's for sure. That's for sure. There's a city just west of Baltimore called Frederick. <SEP> It's about forty miles west. Is that right? And they have a minor league team. And I go out there almost as much as the Orioles. And. <SEP> Is that right? I. It's just a lot of fun. It's free parking. And four bucks now to get in. And the hot dogs are a dollar. And it's just great. How much is an Oriole game? Oriole game? If you park in the lot across the street from the stadium it's four bucks. The cheapest ticket you can normally get is six fifty to seven fifty. <SEP> It's higher than the Rangers. And hot dogs start at a dollar fifty. A-. The food here is outrageous. But you can get a good seat for. It used to be three dollars. But I think it's gone up to four dollars this year. That's nice. <SEP> But it's in the bleachers way out in center field. But it's still nice. You still can see well. And we usually sit there unless somebody gives us tickets box seats or something then we usually sit out there. <SEP> How much are the box seats there? Do you know offhand? Box seats run from eight dollars to twelve dollars. That's a little steeper. I think the most expensive seats in Memorial are eleven bucks. But we're getting a new stadium next year. So. <SEP> So it'll go up. It'll go up. And if it opens. It's something we're really irritated about around here. Or some people are really irritated about. They built the new stadium downtown. And they're saying how there's going to be a lot more parking for the stadium. But I park for free up at Memorial Stadium because I know where I can do it for free. <SEP> And I'm not going to be able to do that downtown. That's a bummer. We. <SEP> Baseball here though is the cheapest game in town. Because the Cowboys. It's outrageous to go to the Cowboy game. And the Mavericks are t-. It's high too. <SEP> So baseball's cheap compared to other games. Weren't you guys supposed to get a stadium in downtown Dallas? <SEP> That didn't go over. It didn't go through. George Bush who's the main owner of the Rangers decided that they'd stay in Arlington. <SEP> So Arlington's going to build a stadium a bigger one. So they're going to stay there. Which is fine because Arlington's got a lot of things to offer. And that was their main money making deal for the city. <SEP> And it would have devastated them if they would have taken it away. Because everything. There's Six Flags right by the stadium there's a Wet'n Wild. And that's. <SEP> All the tourists come there. And they. It would have been devastated. They would have collapsed. So I'm kind of glad they're staying there. Because it's right in the middle of Fort Worth-Dallas. And. That's what I'd always heard. I've. <SEP> I like it there. And I think Dallas has enough to offer that they don't have to hog everything. So I'm glad that they're staying in Arlington. And it's takes us maybe thirty-five to forty minutes to get there from Plano which is not too bad at all. That's about what it takes me to get to Memorial. <SEP> It actually funny that I live just outside of Baltimore. And it takes me almost the same amount of time to go to Frederick as it does to go to the ballpark in Baltimore. Because to go out to Frederick I just jump on the Interstate. <SEP> Is that right? And. Because I live just south of the Interstate. Hop on the Interstate. And the stadium's right off the Interstate. <SEP> So it's I drive west. And I'm there. And and then to go into Baltimore it's fewer miles. But I've got to go stop and go traffic and everything. Do you read. I guess you read SPORTS ILLUSTRATED. But you don't read many sports books. Or. <SEP> Not really. My son does. I have a son that just turned sixteen. And he reads everything he get his hands on. He's reading a Dick Vitelle book right now because he's a real big Dick Vitelle fan. <SEP> He's a basketball fan because he plays for the high school he goes to. And just loves Dick Vitelle which not many people do. But he's reading it. And he's r-. And he says He's so interesting Mom. You just can't believe all the things he's done. <SEP> And he's really enjoying that. And I. And he said Mom you need to read it after I get finished. So maybe I will. I understand there was a really good basketball book called A SEASON ON THE BRINK. I never heard that one. I'm not sure. I don't know. I'm trying to think of the guy's name. It was John Feinstein or something like that wrote it. <SEP> I just heard about it the other night. I was listening to something on the radio about a talk show about sports books. <SEP>. And they mentioned that one. <SEP> I'll have to tell my son about that. I'm sure he'd like it. And I was thinking about. I saw a book kicking around on the history of the A B A which. That would be good. Even when I don't like the sport so much I get interested in the history of sports franchises.
