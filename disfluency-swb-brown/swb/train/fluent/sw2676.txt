Do you live in Plano or work in Plano or both? Both. Both. Are you a T I -er? <SEP> Are you at work right now? So am I. In which building? <SEP> Are you Summit or are you Spring Creek? I'm Spring Creek. <SEP> This is fun. What building are you in? I'm building one. <SEP> I'm building two. At least we found something different. That's. I've never had a call. Not like that. Neither have I. Isn't that funny? I usually get some place. I got a woman in New Jersey the last time I called I think. That's funny. <SEP> That is funny. So. So how's the weather in building two? The weather in building two is cold. It's been cold. It's been cold in the building. Outside the building it's not bad. Typical T I. Listen I got me doing it. Typical Texas Spring. Are you a native to Texas? I'm a transplant. <SEP> From? From California. So what do you think of the Texas weather? Not as nice as California. <SEP> How long have you been here? Five years now. I've been here pretty long. So. <SEP> You know about August then. I've been through five of those. There's no surprises left. A lot of people try to leave the state for a couple of weeks in August for. If they're going to go out of state for vacation that's the time to go. <SEP> Good idea. <SEP> Real good idea. We went up to Wyoming this last Summer during that time. And it was eighty degrees up there. It was beautiful. Nice to get out of Texas for a while. We went to Alaska. That's even farther away. <SEP> That is really nice. It is so cool you wear a jacket. Even in the Summer time. Or keep one handy. Because it rains a lot in Alaska. <SEP> Is that right? It. They call it their liquid gold. <SEP> But it. You get sunshine. And it's lovely. And then it rains just enough to keep everything nice and moist and very green. And blooming. Green. <SEP> It's pretty. Texas isn't bad. <SEP> Not in the Spring. I have to think every year to try to remember what's it supposed to like this time of year. Spring is nice. Because March we usually get a lot of rain in March. It'll seem the news the Harold Taft on the local news. <SEP> March we typically get a lot of rain. And we've had this many inches. And we're right on target. And just seem like we were getting a lot of rain in March. But I. We always do though. It's hard to remember twelve months ago what it was like. <SEP> It. I just wish it wouldn't come all at once. <SEP> That's right. And then we get all that heat. And. It's just that. When it rains it rains. In California you get these nice lovely rains nothing really like downpours like you have here. <SEP> The other day we had some hail the biggest hail I've ever seen in Texas. I live in Garland. <SEP> You got into that bad stuff. We got hail the size of marbles. Just so noisy hitting the house. And the glass on the windows. It didn't break anything. But we went out there afterwards. And there's ice balls the size of marbles all over our lawn. Isn't that strange. I know I. You pick them up. And they're perfectly round. And I go how did they form so perfect like that. <SEP> I think that's one of the strange strange things. And you very seldom see it though. I've seen hail. But usually the size of tiny tiny pebbles. Really small. But this was really large. So it's a drop of water that had come through quite a few rain clouds apparently. Is that correct? I don't know how hail is formed to tell you the truth. <SEP> I think that's. You don't think it's cold enough to. <SEP> It's not on the ground. But in the clouds it is. Must be. I guess. And then I think all that falling would warm it up and melt it. But maybe that's what rounds it. But tumbling. <SEP> I was dumb. I was in Florida for a week on business. And I had called back to the house. I stayed the weekend. And I called back to the house. My housekeeper was baby-sitting my cats and dogs said something to the effect of now we've made the national news don't get upset and don't worry. It's in Garland where all the bad weather is. I said Okay. <SEP> And I watched the news. And I thought that's Garland that's not Plano. I don't have anything to worry about. I was on the plane heading back to Dallas before it dawned on me stupid you own property in Garland. Felt so dumb. <SEP> Finally I got home and found out my property was okay. There was no problem with it. But I guess you just tend to think of where your house is and nothing else. <SEP> And close to that what's called Duck Creek that runs through part of Garland that's the part that always seems to get hardest hit when there's the hard rain. I see. The creek overflows. And a lot of houses around that creek seem to get flooded. <SEP> The streets and stuff around that area get a lot of flooding. That house that I bought is close to a Firewheel golf course. <SEP> Just going to be blocks off of that new highway one ninety that's going through. That's where I live close to that. <SEP> Not quite. I don't live in that Firewheel division. But I live close by there in far north Garland. Is that a nice area? They're supposed to. It's getting built up with more new shopping centers and things. It's a fairly new area. And they're supposed to be building a mall somewhere close by by ninety-three or ninety-four or something. A brand new mall not too far away from that area. <SEP> So. The house that I bought was really really nice. It'd be nice. <SEP> In the Firewheel Estates there whatever. <SEP> Really really nice home very pretty. But you're not living there right now. I'm going to lease it. I see. <SEP> It's investment property. I see. But it's a very nice place. I would cheerfully live there. Of course it's not my home. And I've lived in my home almost ten years. And I've got everything just exactly like I want it. <SEP> But if I were to live some place else it certainly meets my standards. It's a nice house. That's a nice area. Is it on the golf course? It's not. It's off the golf course. And I'll be honest with you. I'm going to have to get a map to figure out exactly where is the golf course versus where my house is. Is that right. <SEP> But it's in the estates that adjoin it. That's a nice area. It is. That really is a nice area. When they get that highway finished you can hop on that and get anywhere you need to go fairly quick. <SEP> That one ninety is just going to be the outermost loop around. Another belt line just farther out. <SEP> Just continue to do that. Where are you from in California? Southern California. <SEP> San Diego? I've lived in San Diego for six years when I was younger and L A area. And my parents live in Anaheim right now. Lived up north of Los Angeles in Thousand Oaks area where the Cowboys have their training camp or used to anyway. I've been through all of that. <SEP> There is an area beyond Thousand Oaks north of Los Angeles that is really an eerie strange looking area with boulders. I won-. They're not really hills. They're more like just huge boulders with very little vegetation. I'm not familiar with what. Is it along the coast or inland. <SEP> It may be a little bit more inland. That is one of the strangest areas I have ever seen. <SEP> I had to go up to T I on business a couple years ago. Out there. <SEP> And we went up that coastline. And I was just amazed how unusual that looks. Hang on just a second. I've got a Los Angeles map. Let me just quick. They have some pretty nice weather out there in Los Angeles. Valley. <SEP> Valley. I know where that is. <SEP> Beyond Thousand Oaks. I know where Valley is. I've been out there before. You don't think that's strange looking. I didn't notice anything strange about it. <SEP> Maybe I'm used to Texas. Maybe Texas the way. <SEP> The elevation is extremely high. It's got curving roads on it. But the. It's just a strange landscape. There's very little vegetation. I don't remember seeing that part of it. I know Valley. It's just a suburb of L A. <SEP> It's a. And they've built some new highways out to that area and things lately. People can get in and out of L A easier. Maybe it's a place I went to. It was far extreme thought we'd never find the place. <SEP> It was interesting. Because we went out the Ventura highway to Thousand Oaks and on up through that way. Sounds interesting. <SEP> I know exactly that area. It's a nice area out there. I love Thousand Oaks. Texas I don't know. Things. You just have less a variety I guess. I don't think it's quite as green. It's green with all the trees and things out here. But it's just. It's green sometime. But it's just. I don't know. <SEP> It doesn't stay green. The really. And in all honesty. I know this sounds like a Texas story. All honesty you haven't seen the hottest of summers if you've only been here five years. We haven't had a really bad one. <SEP> I missed that one of eighty or eighty-two or eighty-one that had the heat wave. <SEP> It may be eighty-two because we bought our house in eighty-one. And we built a pool in eighty-two.
