. Do you go camping very much? I haven't gone camping in years. But it's is something that I've done in the past. How about you? We try to go once maybe twice a summer. Just for a short weekend or something. <SEP> That's pretty average to me. We don't go for the week long thing. But we usually go to a lake area where the campsites are and do that. <SEP> Do you tent camp. Or do you have a camper? A tent. <SEP> That's what I ha-. That's how I camp too. That's how I define camping. Me too. You're really roughing it. The rest of that is really not the same. <SEP> As a matter of fact the majority of the amount of camping I've done has been really roughing it. As a little girl I'd go with my dad and my uncle and my brother. And we went to the Boundary Waters area in Minnesota. So that's really wild. Are you here in local Texas. I mean? <SEP> I'm in Austin. Where are you? I'm in Garland. Right outside of Dallas. <SEP> So we have a five year old. And she was pretty young when we started camping with her. The kids love it. I know. <SEP> They just love it. It's wonderful for them to be outside. I know. And they. There's no T V. And they don't have all these modern toys. And they have to use sticks and rocks and stuff like that to play with. <SEP> And I like that. It's pretty fun. How it. It's really is a good family thing to do. <SEP>. And. We try to go with another couple that have children also. <SEP> And that makes it a lot more enjoyable. Plus we don't have to go out and buy all the equipment and stuff. We kind of split it up. Good planning. Because it really does get expensive if you don't want to rough it all the way. <SEP> Even the sleeping bags those are running a good thirty dollars a pop. And so we've built that up. You're right. But. <SEP> Do you have a boat? Want one bad. Do you? <SEP> Actually you know what I would love? I would absolutely love a sail boat. That doesn't go along with camping. But that's what I would like to have. <SEP> I would too. <SEP> Would too. We usually. Let's see. We try to go to a lake. My husband and this other couple that we go with her husband kind of likes scuba dive? And so we'll go to a lake where they can go do that. We're close enough so they can do that. And the girls can play on the beach area. <SEP> And I would play on the beach area too. That's what I would do. <SEP> That's fun. I'm just sitting here listening to your accent and thinking what a good time the computer is going to have with that. Am I pretty Texan? <SEP> You're pretty Texan. But you know what's really funny? I've had people tell me that I have a Texas accent. And there is just no way I've not picked one up. You don't sound like it to me. <SEP> I've only lived here about six years. Have you? So if I have one it must be very very slight. <SEP> The Yankees can hear it. That's true. That's true. I don't think I do. But a lot of people do say I sound like. I have more of a twang to my voice. <SEP> Are you a native Texan? I sure am. I've lived here all my life. <SEP> Good for you. But. Have you ever been to Austin? We went last summer actually. <SEP> This. How was. I'm wondering I'm really not familiar. I know there are some good places to go camping along the lakes. Is there? We didn't go camping. We drove down to Houston to visit friends. And we went to Galveston and to San Antonio and then up to Austin. And kind of doing the sight seeing type stuff. So we didn't go camping. That would be fun though to go. That's one thing my husband wanted to do on this summer's vacation was to go and camp wherever we went. And I said I'd love that. But. <SEP> It takes a lot more planning. It does. And ever once on my week-long vacation I want to be a little bit pampered by a hotel and a waiter. <SEP>. So we're hoping to do a three day weekend. There's a thing called Pfeiffer Rim. I don't know if you have ever heard of it? <SEP> I haven't. There's a town called Glenrose. I think it's around two hours from here. And it has dinosaur tracks and stuff like that. That sounds great. And it's got one of those wildlife parks. <SEP> I think that'll be fun. So we're going to try to do that on a three day weekend go there. And. Have you ever camped out of state? I haven't. <SEP> Where you should try sometime is Colorado. Where at? It is beautiful. Is it? <SEP> Absolutely beautiful. I've just been up there skiing. And we've driven through but not camping or anything. <SEP> But I would love to camp in the mountains. <SEP> Estes State Park is fantastic. That's what my girlfriend says. She loves that place. You need to go there. She loves that. She says that where we need to go sometime. <SEP> It is. It's high canyon. And there's this little mountain lakes. And it's very peaceful. And in the early fall time. <SEP> I can't remember what type of trees they are. But all the leaves turn yellow. And it's just brilliant. And. I love that. <SEP> You would. You'd like it very much. That's neat. That's neat. I know you would. I used to go camping all the time as a Girl Scout. <SEP> I was too. All the time. I got real used to it then. I felt like we roughed it then. <SEP> We did. We really did. I just don't understand these people that think taking an R V and parking it and sitting inside and watching T V and having your microwave. <SEP> It's not camping. We had to make the fires and dig latrines and everything. <SEP> That is it. You have to get poison ivy and all that good stuff to really be camping. <SEP>. You say you haven't been in years? I haven't. I'm a struggling single mom. Bless your heart. <SEP> And. Thank you. It's. Time is precious. Money's precious. <SEP> And it. I think I haven't been able to do it. And that was one of the things I really thought I'd like to do with my children again. And I'm a little bit fearful of trying that just women. I don't blame you. <SEP> You know? I don't blame you at all. I hope. Years ago it would have been fine. But. <SEP> I really now. I have gone on one little vacation just the girls and I. We drove down to Port Aransas and rented a little efficiency and had a marvelous two nights. <SEP> And that was great. And even at that it was the first time that I ventured out of the city by myself. <SEP> And I stayed in a nice place. But it's real different not to have another adult with you. I kn-. You know. I can imagine. <SEP> I'm just a chicken. I know lots of women would do it all the time. I don't blame you not nowadays. <SEP> I haven't quite adjusted? Are you with T I down there? I was with T I until January. I left T I in January hoping to strike out and find a job where I could make some money. <SEP> So It was a good plan but I haven't yet. Have you? <SEP> I got into sales. And I'm selling telephone systems. That's neat. <SEP> And it's fun. And it's interesting. But it's also pretty challenging. And I haven't started making money yet. It's hard isn't it? So. It's hard. How old are your girls? <SEP> Eleven and fourteen. So I'm old. You're not old. <SEP> You're not old at all. Excuse me just second. <SEP> Honey I'll be wi-. Go ahead. There's someone at the door. Do you need to go? I'm going to listen. We always check and see if we should answer the door at night. <SEP> That's very smart. So I've enjoyed this. Me too. <SEP> And. And good luck. How many have you made so far calls? I haven't made any. I've been just a recipient. Have you? They're all. This is only about my second one I've ever made. I've been a recipient on the others. How many have you had so far do you know? <SEP> I think I've had about four. Four. That's good. Ye-. Very good. <SEP> That's four each. When I had to sup-. This is my Gemini nature. It's like what are you interested in. And it's virtually anything. I'll talk about anything to anybody. I don't. You bet. You bet. <SEP> And it's been real interesting the different personalities. That I run across. I know. I always try to find out where they're from. <SEP> Because it is neat. It really is. <SEP> Then I guess I'll let you go so you can go get the door. And. Thank you. And I enjoyed talking with you. Me too. <SEP> You have a good time camping. When you go next time think of me. Thank you. <SEP>.
