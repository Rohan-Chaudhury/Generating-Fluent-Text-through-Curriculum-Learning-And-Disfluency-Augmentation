You keep up with current events? Somewhat. Somewhat. Not. <SEP> Not as well as I would like to probably. Is that right? But that's the way it goes. Whereabouts in Pennsylvania. <SEP> What? Where in Pennsylvania? State College. I go to Penn State. Do you. <SEP> How's. We're not supposed to talk about that. We're supposed to talk about current events. I'm a current event junkie. So I try to watch the news. And I read the newspaper. And I like to read TIME magazine and PEOPLE magazine to keep up with what's going on in the world. <SEP> I see. What particularly are you interested in? I just pretty little about everything. And then again not everything. <SEP> But I like to know pretty well what's happening. Political things don't interest me a great deal except I do like to stay informed enough to feel like I halfway vote intelligently. But other than that I just. Just the events that happen around the world interest me. Stay in touch with it and feel like I know what's going on. <SEP> I have to say all three of my children none of them are too interested in current events. I see. But I always have been. <SEP> And I stay up with it. But how do you stay aware of most of the current events. Newspaper? T V news or what? Some of both. <SEP> I read the newspapers sometimes. <SEP> And I watch C N N that sort of thing occasionally. That's good. <SEP> And I read magazines and such. You stay up with it pretty well then. Not that badly. <SEP> So I am interested in what's going on. And I'm particularly interested in certain things of course like all the news about Haiti recently because I've been down there. You've been there. <SEP> And. You would be interested in it then. I follow it. I don't just read everything about it. But I'm always aware of what's going on like that. <SEP> Because it's interesting. And I don't know. I feel sorry for those people down there. They've just been so terribly mistreated for so many years. Through Papa Doc. <SEP> That's true. They've never really had a good leader. He was a terrible tyrant. <SEP>. And I think it's been better since he died. But it's still been bad. <SEP> But even that priest that was in control there for a while that they overthrew. I've read some things about him that he wasn't too good himself. He was pretty much a. He didn't mind having people bumped off for certain things. <SEP> But It's one of the reasons the U S didn't do more than they did at the time because they weren't all that excited about him although he's probably better than a lot of them. I see. <SEP> But then again who. Those people are so used to it. I guess it's the only thing that works. So what do you think about the quality of news coverage in America? I think it's pretty darned good. I think we're lucky to have as good a coverage as we have. <SEP> I really do. Sometimes they jump on it and go a little to the extreme. The media does. But that's kind of understandable because of course if you watch it more than once a day it's the same thing over and over and over and over. And I listen to the radio. So you hear so much. You get a little tired of it. But then again so many people only catch it once a day maybe. <SEP> But I think the quality of our news is just I don't believe it could be better. I really don't. <SEP> I think it always could be better. But I would agree that it's pretty good. I don't think so. I don't think our news could be better. <SEP> What else could they do to make it better. I don't see anything that they could do. <SEP> I think that. I don't know. You always want to think everything can be improved upon. The. <SEP> I understand what you're saying. I think that. But by trial and error over the years I think they got it about as good as they're going to get it. <SEP> That may be so. Nothing is perfect. I think that I'm not always satisfied with how deep they dig into things and such. <SEP> That's true. I understand what you're saying. And then again I understand why they can't dig too much deeper. That's why we have C N N. <SEP> C N N has the time to dig deeper. <SEP>
