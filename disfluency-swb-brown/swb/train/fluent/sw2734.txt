What's the. It has a death penalty doesn't it? They just started it again too just late or within the past few years. For quite some time just about every one of the states had given up the death penalty. But now it's coming back into favor. <SEP> They find it is more deterrent. My sociology class at S M U's taught us that it was not a deterrent. But now that's just what they said. I don't know maybe if I went back and took a sociology class now they'd say it is a deterrent. If you compare the figures I think that's where they're coming from. Maybe they've changed their minds. <SEP> The. Maybe that's it. Maybe that's it. Because that was back in the seventies. They are. That was before they adopted the death law again. But I myself am in favor of it particularly for. Crimes murders related with drugs or killing a policemen. I think. I agree. But I think it ought to be expanded to include children. I think they're working on something in Austin now. <SEP> And I'm not sure what it is. I just remember seeing a kind of a synopsis of it. Why stop at children? Why not go to adults too? I'm personally very in favor of it. <SEP> Why should we let them set in prison and work on their college degrees after they've mowed down a class yard full of kids or tried to or given their best effort at doing that. I don't care to support them. <SEP> I don't either. But there is something to be said about. Or just for the sake of argument I'm taking a con. I'm against it. You know yourself how many times have you heard where a citizen was wrongfully arrested and served time at a penitentiary. <SEP> Just recently this black man served nine years for robbery. And then there was the black woman that robbed and shot the furrier. And she was set free too just in two examples in Texas recently. <SEP> But she actually killed the furrier. Or someone. She was charged with murder. And then then they decided it was a case of mistaken identity or something. I didn't retain all those facts very well. But I know what you're. What if we make a mistake. That's it. And that's not one of those things that you can turn the wheel back and reverse everything. <SEP> Right now our laws are so liberal that even with the death penalty in effect I don't think that they're going to use it too frequently unfortunately. I like you say yes. Let's have it give them all a shot get rid of them. I guess though where I would have a problem with it if I were on the jury that handed down the death sentence because it was my judgement the person's guilty. Why should they be sitting in prison getting their college degree. <SEP> That's tougher. It's easier to say it on the telephone. And everyone agree that the death penalty's the way to go. It's a deterrent to crime. They shouldn't catch themselves in that circumstance anyway. But to be one of the ones that decide that would be tougher for me. Very true. I agree with you there. I think I'd probably do it. But we could never say what we would do if we're not in the circumstance. That's a real easy thing to say that I would. But I don't know. <SEP> I myself wouldn't want to be on the jury like that. That's an awful lot to expect of a person to kill somebody is what it amounts to. But that's what they did. It. But they did it because they have a warped mind for some reason. Or rather than have a warped mind it was just the only way to get whatever they wanted. <SEP> And they wanted something more than they respect the human life. I guess we both agree that it should be in effect. <SEP> Hang them. I agree it should be in effect. Also I agree there should be a lot of care in the enforcement. So I guess I would say I want it to be in effect. But I want maybe. I have a problem with this too. I think our courts have too many opportunities for them to go back and get one more chance. <SEP> That's true. Just believe in just about any state in the union a death verdict is an automatic appeal. That's correct. It is. It is. And. I'm inclined to agree with you. I think so. There should be a limit as to the number of appeals. There's some. And maybe I don't remember if this is Texas or not that has something about all drug dealers can be sentenced to the death sentence. <SEP> Not just for dealing in drugs. Convicted drug dealers. It. What's the ru-. <SEP> There are certain circumstances. And I don't remember what they are. They're on the distribution end. They're not selling them. They're distributing them. It's for the large dealers is what it's reserved for. <SEP> And they are in effect killing people. I believe it's any capital crime related to drugs. <SEP> I think that's the way it's worded. Is that how it's worded? I knew it was there. But I. Or is it proposed. Or is it passed? I do believe that's in. I wouldn't swear to it myself. I believe it is. <SEP> But I thought it was in effect. I believe you're right though. I think it is. And I have to agree with that. I think it certainly should be one of the options. I've been fortunate with my children and grandchildren so far that I know. I qualify that heavily. <SEP> Because you never know. But to the best of my knowledge we haven't had a major problem yet. But it just touches so many young people. My children are about in the same age bracket. <SEP> It does. I have four sons myself. And the youngest is twenty-eight. So they are all pretty well grown up. And they all went through it going through high school and everything. And knock wood that they have not. I won't say they didn't try it. I wouldn't know. But they. I doubt very much that they're using it now. In fact I'm sure they don't. I think the oldest is thirty-two. And the youngest is probably twenty-seven twenty-eight. <SEP> It's the same age bracket. And there's four two girls and two boys. And I think one of each experimented very slightly with pot. <SEP> And I think that was the extent of it to the best of my knowledge. That's usually the way it is. It's just try it out with their peers. And none of them even smoke. They don't. They never. Strangely enough their mother and I both smoked when they were growing up. My ex-wife she quit when she was pregnant with the last one. And she never started up again. And I just quit about fourteen months and two weeks ago. That's tough. <SEP> It is. I. And it seems to be getting tougher as time goes by. My husband hasn't quit yet. And he knows he has to. And he knows he should. And he knows. And he knows. But he hasn't. I do respect the fact though that he refuses to smoke in the same room with me. He's very conscious of passive smoking. And he's concerned about it but hasn't quite made it yet. <SEP> When I was still smoking I felt that way. If I was in a public restaurant seated at table with non smokers I would try to pick my seat where the smoke would blow away from them. Or I'd hold the cigarette under the table. I've seen all of this. <SEP> But now the shoe's on the other foot. I'm aware of other people smoking now. Charles will not smoke in anyone else's house except our own. He will get up. And he'll go outside. And he's. So when we're invited to people's house he will not smoke in their house. Which I think is good because there's a lot of people that are very. <SEP> Particularly if they have children. And he tries his best. But the actual quitting he hasn't done. He changed brands to a brand he doesn't like. He put up all of his ash trays. He will not smoke in a comfortable position. But still he's done everything the Smokers Anonymous tell you to do except quit smoking. <SEP> It's a long process. There's a trick I use. <SEP> They used to leave my cigarettes in the glove compartment. How neat. And every time I wanted one I have to go outside and just take one. One at a time. And that gets to be a deterrent. He has his in the kitchen.
