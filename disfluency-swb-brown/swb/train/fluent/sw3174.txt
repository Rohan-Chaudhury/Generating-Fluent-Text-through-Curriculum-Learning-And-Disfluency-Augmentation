I work at T I. And we have of course started random drug testing here. And I haven't gotten called yet. But I feel that it's pretty good if they feel like there is a vast majority of the people at the company doing drugs. Do they feel that way? I think that they thought that there was a lot of drug usage here at T I. But I think our latest statistic said something like ninety-nine point nine eight percent were testing negative on all the testing. <SEP> I think it's a good idea just because I'm opposed to the drugs. <SEP> I think it can cause a lot of problems even though they think they can handle it. It's. I don't know. I don't really liken it to alcohol. But yet that can be carried to an extreme too. <SEP> So I think it's a good idea. And I think just the idea that you may be tested might keep you off of them or get you off of them because you're. I don't know that their job would be at risk. Because I think they may put them into some sort of a program to get them off of drugs. <SEP> I would think that. Is that how they do it at T I maybe. That. I. At T I if you get called in and you test positive for drugs then you're put on a program. And you go through the program. And then you're called six months after you complete the program. And if you test positive then you're terminated. <SEP> I guess I draw a hard line. But I'm in favor of that type of thing. That you have people out there that are responsible for certain things. <SEP> And you expect them to do their job. And it is possible that they can't do as good a job as they might do. That's right. And of course they can also cause injury to other people. <SEP> If they're not fully functional mentally while they're doing their job. They could cause serious injury to another people. And you never know. <SEP> They could just go off the deep end on something whatever they're taking at the time. <SEP> And it would be out of the question. <SEP> Also I guess you can get the wrong kind of stuff and kill yourself just by having a wrong mix of or watered down or whatever all kinds. That's right. <SEP> I sub in the schools. So I've had a. They talk a lot about drugs there. <SEP> And I think it's good that they're trying to start some programs down in the elementary schools. <SEP> But I think they can test all they want for drugs. And if they need to do that as a condition for employment. And I know many of them are doing it. I know my son has had to do it for both Sam's and Wal-Mart. <SEP> And I don't know how many others are doing that. And I think that's good because so many of the kids that are on them are sort of bums that they need to get their life straightened up at an early age. <SEP> That's right. And I don't know. It's just a problem that no one is sure just how to handle I think. <SEP> I think personally I'm for it. There's several reason why I could think of right now why we shouldn't have it such as drug testing runs approximately a thousand dollars a person every time you do it. And. <SEP> It's that high? And. It's very expensive. And. <SEP> I didn't realize it was that expensive. It's not like a normal urinalysis. <SEP> It's very expensive to run them. And I didn't get a raise this year. Because nobody in our company got a raise. But yet they spend all the money on drug testing. <SEP> Just lucky to have jobs. And if they weren't spending all the money on drug testing people could have got a raise. So there's different. I think that's more of a personal view of mine other than a we should have drug testing because there's really a problem. And I know that. But then I have other views to it. <SEP> I didn't think it was that expensive because my son was in probably a week and a half period. And Sam's and Wal-Mart are owned by the same people. <SEP> He took one for Wal-Mart for job hiring. And then Sam's called him. And he took another one. <SEP> And I don't know why they both made him do that since it was so close together. I can see if. Because if it's a thousand dollars that's a thousand dollars they wasted. Theirs might not run a thousand dollars. Our. From what I understanding here at T I they run close to a thousand dollars an employee. <SEP> Maybe they run. I don't know. That's just guessing it. Maybe they run a lot of other tests. Or maybe it's under a health type program that it would catch a lot of things. <SEP> I just can't imagine them screening all these employees paying a thousand dollars to get them. But. For all the pub-. It's.
