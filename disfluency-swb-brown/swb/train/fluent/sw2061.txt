. How you doing? <SEP> Not bad. Not bad. What's your name? Fernando. Fernando. My name is Nick. Wait. Let me turn off my stereo here. <SEP> Because I've been waiting for about ten minutes to get connected to somebody. <SEP> I'm. What time is it over th-. Are you in Dallas? I'm in Detroit. Or not Detroit. I'm in California. Are you? <SEP> I. Because every time I got through I went to Dallas Texas. I'm in North Carolina. <SEP> You're on the. Let's see. On the other coast. Twenty-one. It's midnight almost? What? It's. I'm watching SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE here. <SEP>. I guess we're supposed to talk. What about. Credit card? Wait. How did you get to know about the T I thing? One of my instructors said that they were doing something like this. And. What are you working on? <SEP> A Masters in information systems. I'm doing my Masters in computer science and computer engineering. Where at? At North Carolina State University. <SEP> How do you like it out there? I don't. Because I come from a bigger city than this one. And I'm in Raleigh. And. <SEP> Raleigh Durham. That area. And it's really small. All you have is towns built around universities. Like Chapel Hill? <SEP> So it's basically a bunch of small towns anyway. Kind of quaint little towns. But they don't have a whole lot there. Where you at? <SEP> I'm in Monterey California right now. It's like this town probably has two hundred and fifty thousand people. And that's about it. Two hundred fifty? <SEP> It's a lot bigger than Monterey is. But we're just south of San Jose and San Francisco. And it's only a hour away to a large city. Where do you go? Do you go to Berkeley? <SEP> It's the naval postgraduate school out here. Because I was looking at the doctorate degree in computer science center at Berkeley. <SEP> And they're asking for a G P A of three point seven or something like that. And they're looking for G R E like ninety-nine percentile and this and that. <SEP> And it's like. That's what they look for. Whether or not they get it is hard to say. I know. That's why I didn't apply. For me it was practically impossible to get between ninety and ninety-nine percentile on the verbal part. <SEP> <SEP> It's pretty tough. It's pretty tough. I. Let's face it. And I did the. As far as. I found it a lot of times with regards to education the school only takes you so far. It's what you do. So I don't lose any sleep over stuff like that. Are you going to go for your Doctorate? <SEP> Probably not. I'm in the Navy. And most of the Navy funds that I probably won't do it until I. If I do do it it will be after I get out of the Navy. When do you get out? <SEP> Probably be another twelve years. I like what I'm doing right now. But what if they pay for it? <SEP> Excuse me? What if they pay for? If they pay for a P H D? <SEP> They won't pay for it. I think they have maybe two people a year go get their P H D. Because I know a couple of people here that work for the Army. They civilians or military? I think they're military. But the guy is still in. <SEP>. And he works over in Maryland. <SEP> And so he's doing his Masters here. They gave him a scholarship for a year. And he's doing it in a year and a summer. <SEP> And so he's getting that. And they said they got a lot of benefits and that. That's why you want to join. <SEP> But this guy. You can earn a lot more money. So you say. I go why you still there if you can earn a lot more money once you've get your Masters. They go they got a lot of benefits that would go with it. So. <SEP> A lot of times it's not the money that keeps people in. They like what they're doing. They feel good about what they're doing. That type of thing. It's more. But you. The. Once you get your Masters you can be earning anywhere between thirty-seven forty-five thousand a year. <SEP> And that's not what they're paying. Easily. I'm sure. <SEP> It depends on what rank you are of course. I know. Like I say if you're at an upper level in the rank category you're probably pulling down close to seventy grand a year. But that's. <SEP> Those are few and far between though. It's in I B M. In I B M you can get certain points. <SEP> And everyone's a manager. But nobody can get one more point to become whatever you need to earn so much money. Since I imagine it's fairly competitive. It's. I B M is. There's a joke about I B M which says it's. All the major companies get into a boating race. <SEP> And so I B M says we have to have a team. And then they come in last. And they have this whole team analyze why they came in last. Because the person asked for it. <SEP> Saying. He goes the problem was that there were five people saying row row row and one person rowing. So he goes have you come up with a solution? They go yeah. Change the rower. It's like everyone's a manager. <SEP> But it's like one person does the work. So. <SEP> Too many chiefs and not enough Indians. So. I don't know. That can really slow you down. That's the way it works. That's why they're having problems. Everyone's a manager. And. <SEP> I didn't realize that. It's like the people that actually do the work there are very few. And then the other people just plan it. It's like have you ever seen the commercial for Federal Express with the think tank. <SEP> Push paper around. All these people are just sitting around just going what shall we do? Has anybody thought of anything? <SEP> And then this guy from Federal Express comes along. They go what's that? This track which it's going around the world. And they can tell you where your package is anywhere any time. And so it's the same thing with I B M. So they have this think tank. And they got to come up with ideas. But the thing is that I B M is so stabilized that everybody will buy their stuff. <SEP>. They've got basically a lock on a lot of the market. And a lot of times you figure with the support that they provide. People generally go with that because they figure that you probably won't get fired for getting I B M material. Whereas if you try something different they'll say yeah. And it fails. And you're dead. <SEP> Why didn't you try something more mainline. I B M doesn't fire anybody. Because what they do is they put you in a different job. Which you actually are sitting around not doing anything. <SEP> So you quit. That's their policy. They never fire anybody unless you're caught doing something illegally. <SEP> Illegal or something like that. If you're stealing something or doing anything like that. But they won't let you off. What they'll do is. Suppose you're a manager. So they'll put you into keeping up the paper. <SEP> It's how much paper is going in? And then you say that's not my job. So you quit. <SEP> So in other words that's the way they force people out. That's why they can say there's no layoff policy. <SEP> But they don't really say that. You're always going to have great career conditions. That's kind of sad. But it's like they have just different policy. I don't know. My dad works for them. But it's like in their commercials they never put down any other company. It's like they won't say. <SEP> They're the standard right now. Or as far as that goes people think of computers they think of I B M a lot of times. And the main. Because what happens is they have a good backup policy. <SEP> And anybody can fix it. And so that's what you're going to go for. <SEP> That's a big thing. And it's for example like Leading Edge. Have you ever heard of Leading Edge? They are out of Korea. What? <SEP> Leading Edge. Don't they pro-. They made small personal computers. Small P C -s. They're out of Korea. I don't know. I don't know. But what they did is buy all the parts that I B M would throw away. And build an I B M P C with all the parts that I B M would throw away. <SEP>. <SEP> For example you test a chip. It can't last seven years. But it can last five. I B M says let's throw it away. Leading Edge will say we'll buy it from you. And so that's. They're still around I think. <SEP> I've seen them around anyway. So that's what they do. They buy all the things that I B M throws away. And that's why they're so compatible. Because. And by the time you have computer for five years you're going to throw it away anyway. <SEP> Most people do. Or they have to anyway. There's. In a way you realize. One of my teachers got this computer which. It's voice synthesizing stuff. And he got that. He said it's like. I was testing it. And it was wonderful. And then when you tried to erase and correct all the errors in your voice it takes up all your memory. <SEP> And I want more. And it's Jesus Christ. It's why do you want more. Because it's one second of recording. You put into Wave. And you want to correct the errors into Wave. It takes so much. It's like. Of course it does. By the times it transforms into Wave by mark off model. And you put it in there. And you want to correct those. And then you're trying to make the Wave smooth. So you can approximately. Of course it's going to take a lot. Imagine what it is for us to make mark off models. <SEP> It's amazing. It's Jesus Christ. When you get right down to it the more they can do for you the more memory they're going to require. <SEP> Both in terms in Ram as well as standard memory or disk base. So. Like they say nobody can get enough. It's like once you have something. And it's like. <SEP> You find out more. I was watching this program on T V yesterday. In nineteen seventy-six NASA came up with Three D graphics. <SEP> And they were showing this Three D graphics view of. Like the deal? What? <SEP> Like a hologram? This is like video game stuff. With just graphics on a. <SEP> But the only thing was that it was just lines. If you.
