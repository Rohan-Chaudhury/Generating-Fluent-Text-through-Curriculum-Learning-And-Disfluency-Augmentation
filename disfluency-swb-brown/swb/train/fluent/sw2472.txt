Perhaps this connection. It still echoes. Do you like to cook? I love it. <SEP> I do too. It's kind of hard to find time sometimes. But. Do you work? <SEP> And have a family? I don't have a family. I usually work about fifty hours a week. And by the time I get home I'm so tired it's hard to cook a full meal. <SEP> I expect so. For a dinner party I think one of my favorite things is baked chicken and white wine. That's really weird that you said that because for a dinner party mine is a chicken in a marsala wine sauce. <SEP> So. Where did you get your recipe for it? I guess mostly out of an international cookbook that I have. Mine actually came from the Texas Instruments Cafeteria. <SEP> They. They have a T I plant in Texas in Kingsport? We have. It's in Johnson City. <SEP> And the cafeteria is real good about putting out recipes once a month. They'll put out a recipe of the month. And they put this one out. And I tried it. And it was really good. What is a marsala wine a sweeter wine? <SEP> A little bit sweeter. And it's a red wine. <SEP> And I'm trying to think what else. I roll it in bread crumbs and Parmesan cheese. And then I rub the chicken with a little bit of oil and pour the wine sauce over it the last twenty minutes so that it gets just enough flavor. <SEP> So it kind of browns. And then you put wine over it. <SEP>. That sounds real good. <SEP> And it's really easy too. So. What do you use? What do you serve with it? <SEP> What do you serve with it? I like to serve a wild rice with it. That's what I do too. <SEP> This is really neat. And I. We're big broccoli fans. That's what I've got. I've got steamed broccoli down on mine. <SEP> I just don't think you can go wrong with something like that. It's great. I've got a good dessert recipe. What? Do you like angel food cake? <SEP> I just break it up in a glass bowl. And then I mix up some cream cheese and a little bit of Amaretta and some cool whip. <SEP> And I make a thickened blueberry sauce. And I layer it with angel food cake and the blueberries and then that topping. What time should we be there? <SEP> That sounds wonderful. It is it's great. I love desserts. But since there's only two of us it's really. <SEP> I try to avoid making anything too fancy that we'd like too much and eat too much. I know what you mean. We don't eat desserts much any more. <SEP> But I guess one that I really like that I haven't made in awhile. It's called a fruit pizza. And you take a sugar cookie recipe and spread it out on a pizza pan. <SEP> So you make it like a pizza crust. And then you bake that. And then you take things like kiwi and strawberries and bananas and whatever fresh fruit you want. You use cream cheese and a little bit of orange juice. And I can't remember what else is in it. And you make kind of a glaze. <SEP> And then you layer your fresh fruit on that. And pour that over it? That sounds great. <SEP> It is really good. And it's real light. It would be pretty. And it. Depending on the fruit you use it's real colorful. <SEP> Especially with the kiwi and the strawberries. That would be pretty. But usually I just opt for brownies and vanilla ice cream. We've been fixing something lately that. We've been cooking a lot of turkey breasts. Because it's low fat. <SEP> <SEP> It's just so much better for you. And I've been making a hot sandwich. I toast a piece of whole wheat bread and then put the turkey on it and then slices of the low fat Swiss cheese. And then I make a little honey mustard dressing and put over it and pop it in the microwave. <SEP> That sounds great. It is delicious. <SEP> I wouldn't mind serving that to anybody. And that's something that just it doesn't take a long time to fix. <SEP> It's really good. And it's really good for you. It's real quick. And we eat out a lot. And there are sometimes you just don't feel like eating out. <SEP> And I wish I had something a little bit different to just zap together. Ma-. <SEP> Mix up a little mayonnaise with some dijon mustard and honey until it just. I mix it until it just tastes good to me. <SEP> I was going to say do you just mix it to taste? And it's real good. And it keeps in the refrigerator. <SEP> How long does it keep. Do you. You wouldn't have to make. It keeps a long time. And you wouldn't have to mix that much together even. It keeps a long time. <SEP> I'm sorry I keep coughing. I've had a bad cold. And I put a little yogurt in it too. Plain? Plain yogurt? If I. Just plain yogurt. It gives it a little tang. <SEP> I'll bet that is really good. It makes a great sandwich. I'm going to have to think of that. We're getting company tonight. Are you. <SEP> And I have been debating what to cook because one of my guests is a vegetarian. That's kind of hard. So we're going to. I think we'll try to do something a little bit. We might try to grill some flounder or salmon steaks. They'll eat fish? <SEP> She'll eat fish. And I usually. When they come down I'll grill those and brush on a little lemon butter sauce. <SEP> And definitely go with it will have to be a rice dish lots of vegetables to make up for the lack of meat. That sounds good. <SEP> I had a recipe from that INTERNATIONAL COOKBOOK TWO that's a great salad in summertime. Do you garden or not? We don't. Our next door neighbors do. And a lot of times they'll give us something. It's just sliced tomatoes. And I put it on a glass plate because it looks real pretty. Sliced tomatoes and then green pepper strips just over it and some red onion slices and just a little bit of basil and then a little Italian dressing over it. <SEP>. <SEP>. <SEP> And everybody loves it. And it's so easy. And it's delicious. That's what I was just thinking. It doesn't sound like it would be hard at all. It isn't. <SEP> Where did you get. And you can put some cucumber slices on too. Where did you get this cook book? I got it at the Checkbook Store. <SEP> And it's got all these beautiful pictures in there that are inspiring. It's going to say edited by Charlotte Turgeon editor of. LaRoute Gastro LaMink. <SEP> The creative cooking course. I'll might have to visit the State Book Store. I'm trying to see who it's published by Ottenheimer. I've never heard of it. <SEP> I haven't either. This edition is published by Bonanza Books. It's a big book. But it was not expensive. <SEP> The ones that I've been wanting to get. I guess you've seen the THREE HUNDRED SIXTY-FIVE WAYS TO COOK CHICKEN and the THREE HUNDRED SIXTY-FIVE WAYS TO COOK PASTA. <SEP> I've been wanting to get those because we eat a lot of chicken. We do too. And we do eat a lot of pasta. <SEP> We just said the other night it wouldn't be too difficult to do without red meat. That's right. I don't think it would. We don't have that much of it now. As long as we have plenty of vegetables and lots of chicken. <SEP> I stir fried some the other night though. Some beef and broccoli strips. It was good. But it didn't have much beef in it. I've got a Wok that we don't use near as often as we used to. <SEP> We used to stir fry a lot especially a lot of chicken and a lot of rice dishes. It just takes the time to cut everything up. But usually if I take a day off or on the weekend especially I try to cook real food. Cook. <SEP> And at least cook a couple of dishes ahead. <SEP> So that we can have those to enjoy. One of my daughters sent me a COLORADO COOK BOOK put out by the Junior League of Denver. <SEP> Have you ever seen any put out by Junior Leagues? Cause we have some local ones. They are great. <SEP> And we have a share alike column in the paper where people write in and share recipes or write in and say I'm looking for this recipe. <SEP>. And that's where I get a lot of my recipes. They are usually good aren't they? <SEP> And I got a real good one from a doctor's office one time. Is that right. What was that? It's a baked bean recipe. <SEP> And you mix baked beans and Lima beans. And let's see I guess. You buy the canned baked beans? Just mix the canned beans together and brown sugar and molasses and bake them in catsup. <SEP> And you just bake it. And it's like a spicier baked bean dish. That sounds. <SEP> And you can add hamburger if you want to give it a little more body. That sounds good. <SEP> So I try to always keep my eyes open because a lot of time you can find really good recipes where you wouldn't even think about it. So I try to always keep a little notebook in my purse. Jot them down? <SEP> But it's been.
