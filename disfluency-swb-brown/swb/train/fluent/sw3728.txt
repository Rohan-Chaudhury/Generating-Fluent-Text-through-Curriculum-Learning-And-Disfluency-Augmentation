What. Do you watch much T V. Or. I don't watch much T V. Usually the reason I will turn it on is to hear the news. The news. <SEP> But I don't think of that every day even. I think I get most of my current events. I get them from everywhere. I sometimes watch T V if I. I guess I watch T V if I haven't read the paper that day. We don't get a paper. But I work at a. I teach a college class. And. <SEP> There's a. The library has a paper. And so I often drop in on a break and read it. And I keep the radio on quite a bit when I'm home. <SEP> And then I figure if there's big news I'll hear it from my husband when he gets home or someone else. I also. I get it from all over. I watch the news every day. And we have a news. We get the newspaper and magazines anything. <SEP> I'm. I read a lot. So I get. I'm really up on current affairs. I get the news and everything. <SEP> What's your favorite news. Do you get a news magazine. Or. I'm not getting an-. I'm not getting any news magazines. But as I said I do. It's easy to keep up on current event- especially when you get a paper every day. <SEP> We've got. <SEP>. And. <SEP> Are you satisfied with the quality of coverage? I don't know. Is there anything missing? I. It's kind of hard to know. And I don't know what are we supposed to compare it to the quality. <SEP> Whatever they tell you. I guess I'm satisfied. I. They're supposedly covering everything that happens. So. You know. <SEP> I do feel a little bit like. Being from California and wanting to hear. I've heard through the grapevine sometimes that there's been an earthquake or sliding or something. And. I don't ever hear it in the news here. <SEP> Sometimes it's such a. It's so slight the tremors are so slight that they don't even bother putting it in the paper. <SEP> But most of the times I find that even if they do have tremors out there there'll be a small article in the paper about it. But. <SEP> I sometimes feel like the Dallas paper and the DALLAS NEWS the top headlines are always a murder. That's what sells papers. That's because there's a high crime rate. <SEP>. That's been like that since the first newspaper. <SEP> I'm sure. But I don't know. I guess I'm satisfied. I don't. What basis of comparison do we have really? <SEP> We don't get a. That's true. We certainly get enough coverage. We can get news. There's even the C N N channel where we can get world news twenty-four hours a day. I was going to. <SEP> Sometimes you don't even want to be bothered with the news because it's all so bad. It's all so negative. <SEP> Often times. But. So. We have to keep talking I guess. <SEP> I guess we can end. It's just whenever we're. Is it really? <SEP> Have you always gone until the recording? I don't. I guess we're not supposed to. I don't know. I guess we're supposed to wait. <SEP> Or I don't know. <SEP> I. One. Was it last week we were supposed to talk about gardening. And it was really funny. I mixed it made the call. And it happened to be my friend who lives a few blocks away. <SEP> And it was really. We were laughing. I mean. But we don't really do any gardening. So that took a minute. And then we just talked about whatever. <SEP> Interesting. Some topics. Really this topic this is. There really isn't much to say after you tell the person where they find their sources of information from. <SEP>. And then if they're satisfied. And that's about it really. <SEP> It's hard to talk for five minutes on this. <SEP> I guess I can just say it bothers me that I hear a lot on the news that. It seems like some things are sensationalized or some things are. You'll hear one report. And then you'll hear that they didn't.
